This falls under the category of **Power Grasps**, specifically the **Power Spherical Grasp**.

Here's why:

1.  **Object Shape:** A tennis ball is a spherical object.
2.  **Grasp Mechanism:** The Spherical Grasp involves the fingers and thumb wrapping around the curved surface of the object, often with the palm also in contact, to enclose it securely.
3.  **Function:** This grasp provides stability and allows for the application of force (power), which is necessary for actions like holding, throwing, or bouncing a tennis ball.

data/cd/cd2.jpg,"['power disk', 'precision disk']",tripod,"Based on Feix's 2009 grasp taxonomy:

The object is a thin, flat, light disc. Handling it typically involves careful manipulation to avoid damage or smudging the data surface. This primary function indicates a **Precision Grasp**, as opposed to a Power Grasp used for stability or applying force.

Among the specific precision grasps described by Feix:

1.  **Tripod Grasp / Quadpod Grasp:** Used for manipulating small objects (like pens) with 3 or 4 fingers and the thumb. A CD is too large for these.
2.  **Palm Pinch:** Pinching the object against the palm. Possible but not the most common or stable way to hold a CD.
3.  **Tip Pinch:** Object pinched between the fingertips of the thumb and one or more fingers. This describes a common way to pick up or hold a CD by its edge (thumb on top, fingers underneath).

While the most common and recommended way to handle a CD is often by placing fingers through the central hole and supporting it with the thumb on top, this specific action doesn't neatly fit into one of the standard named grasps in Feix's primary list (like Tip Pinch, Tripod, etc.). However, this method is also clearly a **Precision Grasp** due to the need for careful control.

Considering the standard named grasps available in the taxonomy and a common method of handling the CD precisely by its edge, the **Tip Pinch** is the most applicable specific grasp name from Feix's classification.

Therefore, the best grasp category is Precision Grasp, and a specific named grasp applicable to handling a CD (by its edge) is the **Tip Pinch**.

The most appropriate category of grasp for this object is a **Precision Grasp**.

Within Precision Grasps, which are characterized by holding the object away from the palm using the tips or pads of the fingers and thumb for manipulation and control, the common and best grasp for a DVD would be:

1.  **A Grasp Utilizing the Central Aperture:** This is arguably the safest and most common method when inserting or removing the disc. It involves inserting one finger (typically the index or middle finger) through the central hole of the disc and using the thumb (and potentially other fingers) on the outer edge or bottom surface of the disc to support and control it. This keeps fingers entirely off the sensitive data surface.

While another method is holding the disc around the edge with the thumb and opposing fingers (a form of **Disk Grasp**, which is a type of precision grasp), the method using the central hole minimizes the risk of touching the data area.

Therefore, the best grasp based on functionality and avoiding damage, fitting within Feix's Precision Grasp category, is the one **utilizing the central aperture with opposing thumb support on the edge/surface**. This is a specialized form of Precision Grasp for handling flat, circular objects with a hole."

data/cd/cd20.jpg,"['power disk', 'precision disk']",lateral,"Based on Feix's 2016 GRASP taxonomy and considering the typical ways humans handle a thin, flat, circular object like a CD for manipulation (e.g., inserting into a player, placing in a case), the most appropriate grasp falls under the **Precision Grasp** category.

Specifically, two very common and suitable precision grasps for a CD are:

1.  **Disk (Pad Opposition):** This involves using the pads of the thumb and one or more fingers to grasp the disk along its outer edge. This provides good control for picking up, placing, or inserting the CD.
2.  **Lateral Pinch (Pad-to-Side):** This involves holding the CD between the pad of the thumb and the side of the index finger. This is a very common way to carry or hand over a CD.

While both are excellent candidates and widely used, the **Disk (Pad Opposition)** grasp (Subtype 1.6 in Feix's taxonomy) is arguably the most representative ""manipulative"" grasp for tasks like inserting a CD into a drive, which requires control around the edge. The **Lateral Pinch** (Subtype 1.10) is equally valid and very common for simpler handling like carrying.

Therefore, based on the object's properties and typical manipulation needs, the best grasp is most likely a **Precision Grasp**, specifically the **Disk (Pad Opposition)** or **Lateral Pinch** subtype. The ""Disk (Pad Opposition)"" is a strong candidate as it is specifically named for this type of object and grasp."
data/cd/cd9.jpg,"['power disk', 'precision disk']",,"Based on Feix's grasp taxonomy, the best grasp for handling a disc like the one shown is typically a **Disc** grasp.

Specifically, this falls under the **Precision Grasp / Pad Opposition** category. Common variations for a disc are:

*   **Disc 3-finger:** Thumb opposing the index and middle fingers on the edge of the disc.
*   **Disc 4-finger:** Thumb opposing the index, middle, and ring fingers on the edge of the disc.

These grasps allow holding the disc by its edge, avoiding contact with the data surface. While a different grasp might be used (like putting a finger through the center hole and supporting the edge, which might relate to a variation of a Lumbrical or Plate grasp in some taxonomies), Feix's taxonomy explicitly includes ""Disc"" grasps tailored for this type of object held by the edge."

2.  **G14 - Plate Grasp:** This grasp involves the thumb opposing the fingers around the edge of a flat object. This is also a common way to hold a CD/DVD, gripping it by its outer rim with the thumb on top and fingers underneath.

Both the **Disc Grasp (G13)** and the **Plate Grasp (G14)** are suitable for this object, as they are specifically defined for handling flat, disc-like objects. The choice between the two might depend on the specific task (e.g., inserting into a drive vs. handing it to someone). However, they fall under the category of grasps for handling flat objects.

Considering the stability provided by supporting the surface, the **Disc Grasp (G13)** which spans the object's surface is often considered a primary method for handling CDs/DVDs securely to prevent bending."
data/cd/cd3.jpg,"['power disk', 'precision disk']",,"Based on Feix's GRASP taxonomy, the best grasp for a CD/DVD is a **Precision Grasp**.

Here's why:

1.  **Object Properties:** The CD is a thin, flat, light object with a sensitive surface (the data side) that should not be touched. Handling requires control and care, not force.
2.  **Typical Handling:** CDs are typically held by the edges with the thumb and fingers, or by placing a finger through the central hole while supporting the other side. Both methods avoid touching the data surface.
3.  **Feix Taxonomy Fit:**
    *   **Power Grasp:** Not suitable, as the object is light and doesn't require force.
    *   **Precision Grasp:** This category involves using the fingertips and thumb for fine manipulation and control. Holding the CD by the edge with opposing thumb and fingers (a form of pulp or pad opposition grasp applied to a thin edge) fits perfectly into the Precision Grasp definition. The alternative of putting a finger through the hole and supporting the other side also relies on fingertip/pad control, aligning with precision principles.

The most common and stable way to hold a CD described within the general types of Feix's taxonomy is by the edges using finger and thumb pads for controlled manipulation, which falls under the **Precision Grasp** category."
data/cd/cd22.jpeg,"['power disk', 'precision disk']",,"Based on the image showing a CD and considering typical human interaction with this object, the most common and arguably ""best"" grasp for stable handling and manipulation (like inserting into a drive) aligns best with a specific type of **Intermediate Grip** within Feix's GRASP taxonomy.

Here's the breakdown:

1.  **Object Analysis:** The object is a flat, thin, light disc with a central hole. Its primary uses involve transport, insertion, and removal. Applying significant force *with* or *to* the object is rare during typical handling. Stability and control to avoid scratching are key.

2.  **Typical ""Best"" Grasp:** The most secure and functional way humans typically grasp a CD for handling is by putting the **thumb through the central hole** and supporting the disc's underside with the **fingers** (usually index and middle, or multiple fingers). This grip provides excellent stability, allows for precise positioning, and minimizes contact with the data surface.

3.  **Mapping to Feix's Taxonomy:**
    *   **Power Grips:** These involve full palm enclosure and force transmission (e.g., cylindrical, spherical). The CD grip doesn't fit this description as the palm is not enclosing the object for applying force.
    *   **Precision Grips:** These involve using fingertips or pads for fine manipulation or pinching small objects. While the CD grip requires control, it involves a larger part of the hand supporting a larger, flat object, rather than manipulating a small feature with fingertips.
    *   **Intermediate Grips:** This category includes grips for objects that don't fit neatly into power or precision, often involving flat objects, carrying, or specific tool handling. The CD grip fits well here. It's about stable handling and transport of a light, flat object.

4.  **Specific Grip within Intermediate:** Within Feix's 33 grips, this specific configuration (thumb through hole, fingers supporting underside) is sometimes considered a variant or example falling under or related to:
    *   **G19 - Flat Pinch:** This involves thumb opposing fingers on a flat surface. The CD grip is structurally similar, with the thumb on one ""side"" (through the hole) opposing fingers on the other ""side"" (the underside surface). However, the thumb's position *in the hole* is a defining feature not perfectly captured by a generic ""Flat Pinch"" description which might imply pinching the edge or flat surface without using a hole.
    *   **G27 - Plate Grip:** This is described as holding a plate horizontally. While the object is different, the *purpose* (stable horizontal carrying of a flat object) is similar. However, the *mechanism* (thumb through hole vs. fingers curled under rim) is different.

Given the commonality and stability of the thumb-through-the-hole grip for a CD, and its function focused on stable handling of a flat, light object rather than high force or intricate fingertip manipulation, it is best classified as a specific application or variation within the **Intermediate Grip** category. While not always listed as a standalone named grip like ""CD Grip"" in all versions of the taxonomy, its characteristics align most closely with this category, specifically resembling a functional blend of a Flat Pinch for a holed object designed for stable carrying like a Plate.

Therefore, the best grasp for this object, according to the principles of Feix's taxonomy, is a variation of an **Intermediate Grip**, characterized by the thumb placed through the central hole opposing fingers supporting the underside."
data/cd/cd4.jpg,"['power disk', 'precision disk']",,"Based on Feix's GRASP taxonomy, the object is a disk. The most suitable grasp type for holding and manipulating a disk-shaped object like a CD or DVD is the **Disk grasp**.

This grasp is characterized by applying opposing forces to the flat surfaces of the disk, typically using the thumb on one side and one or more fingers on the other, or using the central hole for stabilization. It's primarily used for manipulation tasks like inserting the disk into a drive, labeling it, or simple transport."
data/cd/cd10.jpg,"['power disk', 'precision disk']",precision disk,"Based on Feix's grasp taxonomy and considering the properties of a DVD (thin, flat, circular object requiring careful handling), several grasp types are relevant. The ""best"" grasp can depend on the specific task (e.g., picking up, inserting into a drive, placing in a case).

However, considering a general, careful way to handle the object, the following are strong candidates:

1.  **Precision Disk Grasp:** Holding the flat object with fingertips. This is a common way to handle a DVD carefully, either by the edges or by placing fingertips on the non-data side, often used when picking it up, examining it, or placing it into a case or drive slot without touching the sensitive data surface.
2.  **Lateral Pinch:** Holding the object's edge between the thumb and the side of the index finger. This is a very common and functional grasp specifically used for inserting the DVD into a drive or slot.

Given the ambiguity of ""best"" without a specific task, and the image showing the entire disk without a hand or context of use, both Precision Disk Grasp and Lateral Pinch are highly relevant. Precision Disk covers a more general careful handling using fingertips, while Lateral Pinch is specific to edge manipulation during insertion.

The image itself highlights the surface and the edge, supporting both possibilities. However, if we consider a grasp for careful general handling, **Precision Disk Grasp** seems a strong fit as it describes holding the flat object with fingertips, which is crucial for avoiding damage and maintaining control. Lateral Pinch is perhaps more specific to the act of insertion.

Therefore, based on the object's nature and typical careful handling, a strong candidate for a ""best"" grasp type is the **Precision Disk Grasp**.

In this grasp, the CD is held by its edge between the pad of the thumb and the side or pads of one or more fingers (typically the index and/or middle fingers). This allows for stable control and manipulation of the thin, flat disc.

Another possible grasp, especially for carrying, could be the **Plate/Pad** grasp, where the flat object is supported by the palm and fingers from underneath and held down by the thumb on top. However, the **Lateral** grasp is often preferred for manipulation tasks as it minimizes touching the sensitive surfaces of the CD.

Considering typical interaction with a CD, the **Lateral** grasp provides excellent control and protects the read surface, making it arguably the most appropriate ""best"" grasp for general handling and manipulation from the taxonomy."

This involves opposing the thumb pad against the pad of one or more fingers (typically the index finger) to grip the edge of the disc.

This avoids touching the data surface and provides a secure hold.

In Feix's taxonomy, this specific grasp is often classified under a category for handling objects with holes or as a specific type of **Disk Grasp**. It leverages both the flat shape and the presence of the central hole.

data/cd/cd14.jpg,"['power disk', 'precision disk']",,"Based on Feix's grasp taxonomy and considering how people typically handle a CD delicately while avoiding the data surface, especially for tasks like insertion, the grasp using the center hole is a common and effective method.

Examining the specific grasp types listed in Feix's taxonomy:
-   The ""Ring grasp"" is described as ""The object is held by inserting fingers through the hole and opposing them with the thumb on the outside (e.g. a ring, a donut).""
A CD is a thin, flat disc with a central hole, essentially functioning as a large, thin ring in terms of how it's held using the hole. The common ""CD grasp"" involves putting a finger (usually index or middle) through the hole and opposing it with the thumb on the edge or underside. This aligns well with the description of the ""Ring grasp"".

This grasp allows for precise manipulation and carrying, fitting within the general category of precision tasks, although ""Ring grasp"" is a specific named grasp within the taxonomy rather than a top-level category.

Therefore, the best grasp for a CD based on Feix's taxonomy, particularly considering the common method utilizing the central hole (hinted at by the crops), is the **Ring grasp**.

data/cd/cd11.jpg,"['power disk', 'precision disk']",lateral,"Based on Feix's GRASP taxonomy and considering the typical and safest way to handle a CD/DVD to avoid damaging the data surface, the best grasp is one that utilizes the center hole for support while optionally providing stability on the outer edge.

This type of grasp involves inserting a finger (typically the index or middle finger) through the center hole of the disc and supporting the edge with the thumb and/or other fingers. The primary function is to **support** the disc's weight and allow it to be moved or placed without touching the sensitive data area.

Within Feix's taxonomy:

1.  It is **not a Power Grasp:** Power grasps are designed for applying force or securely holding heavy objects (e.g., Cylinder, Sphere, Hook, Plate/Lateral Power). A CD is light and doesn't require force.
2.  It is **not a typical Precision Grasp:** Precision grasps are for fine manipulation of small objects using fingertips (e.g., Tip, Palmar/Tripod, Lateral/Key Pinch). While the outer edge might be held with fingertips/thumb, the primary support comes from the finger in the hole, and the manipulation isn't ""fine manipulation"" of the disc itself but rather positioning it.
3.  It best fits into the category of a **Support Grasp** or an **Intermediate Grasp**. While ""Support Grasp"" isn't always listed as a primary prehensile category in some simplified versions of taxonomies, Feix's paper discusses functional categories like support. This grasp uses the hand to support the object's weight and structure, taking advantage of the object's specific geometry (the hole).

Therefore, the best grasp for a CD/DVD, according to the function and common handling method, is best described as a **Support Grasp** or an **Intermediate Grasp** that leverages the center hole and outer edge for stable, non-damaging handling."
data/cd/cd12.jpeg,"['power disk', 'precision disk']",tripod,"Based on Feix's GRASP taxonomy, the ""best"" grasp for a CD/DVD depends on the specific task being performed, as the taxonomy classifies grasps by function and form. However, considering the common ways humans interact with a single CD for its primary purpose (handling, inserting, removing), two main types come to mind that fit within Feix's classification:

1.  **Precision Grasp - Pinch Grasp (2- or 3-Finger Pinch) on the Edge:**
    *   **Description:** This is perhaps the most common and recommended way to handle a CD. The disk is held by its outer edge using the thumb and one or two fingers (typically index or index and middle finger). The contact is made on the non-data side of the edge.
    *   **Why it fits:** This is a *Precision Grasp* because it involves using the fingertips or pads for fine manipulation (guiding into a drive, picking up without touching the surface). It's a specific type of *Pinch Grasp* as the object is held between the thumb and opposing fingers without significant palm involvement for stability or power. It allows for controlled movement and avoids touching the data surface, which is crucial for this object.

2.  **Precision Grasp - Variant using the Center Hole (Often combined with Edge/Underside Support):**
    *   **Description:** The index finger is placed through the center hole, and the disk is supported or stabilized with the thumb and/or other fingers on the outer edge or underside.
    *   **Why it fits (conceptually):** While Feix's taxonomy primarily focuses on how the *outer shape* of an object is gripped, this method is highly characteristic of handling a CD, especially when placing it on a spindle drive or lifting it from a flat surface without sliding. It's a form of *precision manipulation* leveraging a specific feature of the object. The overall goal is precision placement and avoiding the data surface, aligning with the *Precision Grasp* category's purpose, even if it's a specific object-dependent variation not explicitly named as a standard pinch or tripod. The support on the edge or underside often still involves a pinch-like action or finger pad contact for control.

Other grasps might be used for different tasks (e.g., a **Plate Grasp** - a type of Power Grasp - could be used to carry a stack of CDs, supporting them from underneath with an open hand), but for handling a *single* CD as depicted for typical use, the **Precision Pinch on the Edge** and the **Center Hole supported Precision Grasp** are the most appropriate and frequently observed grasps aligning with Feix's classification principles.

The most ""best"" or typical *protective* grasp for a single CD is the **Precision Pinch Grasp on the Edge**, as it directly supports the object while keeping potentially damaging contact away from the data surface."
data/cd/cd13.jpeg,"['power disk', 'precision disk']",,"Based on Feix's GRASP taxonomy (Feix et al., 2009), the most appropriate and common grasp for a CD or DVD is a type of **Precision Grasp**.

1.  Placing the **thumb through the central hole**.
2.  Supporting the disc from the opposite side (often the edge or the underside near the edge) with one or more **fingers** (usually index and middle fingers).

This grip is classified as a Precision Grasp because it allows for careful manipulation (like inserting into a drive or preventing scratches) and doesn't rely on power or full hand wrap. It's a specialized grip adapted to the specific geometry and handling requirements of a disc with a hole."
data/cd/cd7.jpg,"['power disk', 'precision disk']",tripod,"Based on Feix's grasp taxonomy, the object (a CD) is a flat, thin disk that is relatively light and requires careful handling to avoid damaging the surface. Therefore, the appropriate grasp type would fall under the category of **Precision Grasps**, rather than Power Grasps.

Within the Precision Grasps, the most suitable methods for handling a CD typically involve:

1.  **Holding the edge:** This usually involves using the pads of the thumb and one or more fingers (index, middle) on opposite sides of the edge of the disk. This fits well with the description of a **Pad Pinch** or potentially a variant of a **Prismatic** grasp if holding with multiple fingers on one side, but **Pad Pinch** is a strong candidate for holding the thin edge between thumb and finger pads.
2.  **Using the center hole:** A common method is to place a finger (like the index or middle finger) through the center hole and stabilize the disk with the thumb and/or other fingers on the edge. While not a primary named category like ""Tripod"" or ""Pinch"" in the simplified Feix list, this is a highly functional **Precision Grasp** specifically adapted for this object's geometry, allowing excellent control and avoiding surface contact. It could be considered a specialized type of precision manipulation grasp.

Considering the need for control, stability, and avoiding surface contact, both methods are suitable precision grasps. However, the act of holding the *edge* between the thumb and finger pads is a direct mapping to a defined type in Feix's taxonomy:

The best grasp based on Feix's taxonomy for carefully handling a CD by its edge is a **Pad Pinch**, which is a type of **Precision Grasp**. While the ""finger through hole"" method is also a common precision technique for this object, the edge-holding method corresponds more directly to the explicitly named ""Pad Pinch"" type in the taxonomy for holding flat, thin objects by their edges with control."

*   **Support:** The hand and fingers are used to support the flat surface of the plate from underneath, holding it against gravity and keeping it stable. You might also use your thumb on the rim for added stability, but the core action is support rather than a power or precision grip on the object itself.

Other grasp types from the taxonomy (Power, Precision, Intermediate) are generally not suitable for the primary function and form factor of a paper plate.

For lifting a flat, relatively light object like a paper plate from a surface, the most appropriate grasp from Feix's taxonomy is likely the **Friction Lift**, which is a sub-type of the **Lifting** category.

*   **Friction Lift:** In this grasp, you slide fingers (and potentially the palm) underneath the flat object and use friction between the hand and the object's surface to lift it. This fits perfectly for how one would typically pick up a paper plate lying flat on a table.

Once the plate is lifted and held, especially if it contains food, the grasp might transition into a different type, often involving **Support** where the hand is placed flat underneath the plate to cradle it, which Feix's taxonomy would likely classify under **Non-Prehensile Interactions** or **Support grasps**, as the object is resting *on* the hand rather than firmly grasped *by* it.

2.  **Action:** When picking up a plate lying flat, you typically extend your fingers and thumb relatively parallel to each other across the surface of the plate to lift it. The palm may or may not be in full contact depending on the specific hand/plate size, but the fingers and thumb provide the primary opposing forces for the lift.
3.  **Taxonomy Fit:** Feix's definition of the Parallel Extension grasp includes using extended fingers and thumb opposing each other across a flat object, with the palm potentially in contact. Examples often include grasping books, trays, or tablets, which are similar in form factor to a plate in this context.

This perfectly describes how one typically holds a plate (e.g., supporting it from underneath with the palm and fingers spread, or gripping the edges with fingers underneath and thumb on top).

2.  **Precision Grasps:** Used for manipulation and control with fingertips. These are not suitable for stably supporting or carrying a plate.

Therefore, according to Feix's GRASP taxonomy, the best grasp for a plate is likely the **Disk Grasp**, which falls under the **Power Grasp** category. This grasp provides the necessary stability and support for handling a flat, circular object like a plate."
data/plate/plate32.jpg,"['extension type', 'palmar']",,"Based on Feix's GRASP taxonomy and the object being a flat, oval plate, the best grasp type is an **Intermediate Grasp (G3)**, specifically the **Plate/Sheet grasp**.

This grasp is characterized by holding a flat object (like a plate or sheet of paper) with fingers supporting it from underneath or gripping the edge, often with the thumb on top or gripping the opposite edge. This aligns perfectly with how one would typically pick up or carry a plate."
data/plate/plate31.jpg,"['extension type', 'palmar']",,"Based on Feix's grasp taxonomy and the object being a plate, the best grasp is the **Plate Grasp**.

This grasp is specifically defined in the taxonomy for handling flat, disc-shaped objects like plates. It typically involves the fingers supporting the underside of the plate while the thumb presses down on the top surface or rim for stability when lifting and carrying."
data/plate/plate2.jpeg,"['extension type', 'palmar']",,"Based on Feix's grasp taxonomy, the best grasp for a paper plate is the **Plate Grasp**.

This grasp is a specific type within the taxonomy designed for supporting flat objects like plates. It involves the hand being held flat or slightly cupped, providing support from underneath with the palm and fingers. While other grasps like a pinch might be used to pick up an empty plate, the Plate Grasp is the functional and most common way to hold a paper plate, especially when it contains food, providing necessary support. It can be considered a type of **Power Grasp** focused on support rather than manipulation."

This is an **Intermediate Grasp**. It involves holding a flat object like a plate, typically either supporting it from underneath with the palm and fingers, or gripping the edge with fingers below and the thumb on top of the rim. This grasp is specifically defined in the taxonomy for handling objects of this shape and function."
data/plate/plate30.jpeg,"['extension type', 'palmar']",,"Based on Feix's grasp taxonomy, the best grasp for holding a plate like the one shown in the image, particularly for carrying or supporting it, is typically the **Platform grasp**.

Here's why:

1.  **Object Shape:** The object is flat and relatively large.
2.  **Task:** The common tasks involving grasping a plate are carrying, supporting, or holding it steady.
3.  **Feix's Taxonomy:** Feix et al. classify grasps based on hand posture and contact points. The ""Platform grasp"" (also sometimes referred to as a ""Tabletop grasp"" or a type of ""support grasp"") is specifically described for holding objects from underneath, resting on the palm and/or fingers. In this grasp, the hand acts as a stable base, and there is minimal opposition between the thumb and fingers required specifically to hold the object against gravity (though fingers may curl slightly around the edge for stability).

While other grasps might be used in specific situations (like a side grasp with thumb on the rim and fingers underneath, which could be a variation), the Platform grasp is a fundamental way to support a flat object like a plate from below, aligning well with Feix's definition of using the hand as a support surface."
data/plate/plate19.jpg,"['extension type', 'palmar']",,"Based on Feix's grasp taxonomy, the best grasp for the object shown, a plate, is the **Plate grasp**.

data/plate/plate5.jpg,"['extension type', 'palmar']",,"Based on Feix's grasp taxonomy, the best grasp for this object (a paper plate) when being used to hold food is the **Support** grasp.

The Support grasp is used when the primary function is to bear the weight of the object, typically from underneath, using the fingers and palm or a combination thereof, often with a large contact area. This aligns perfectly with how one holds a plate to prevent its contents from falling."
data/plate/plate15.jpeg,"['extension type', 'palmar']",,"Based on Feix's GRASP taxonomy, the most suitable grasps for handling a plate like the one shown (a flat, rigid, disk-like object) typically fall under the **Power Grasps** category, specifically:

1.  **Disk Grasp:** This grasp is specifically defined for holding flat objects like plates, disks, or trays. It involves supporting the object from underneath with the palm and/or fingers, often with the fingers curled around the edge for stability. This provides a secure hold suitable for carrying weight.

2.  **Lifting Grasp:** While more general, this describes the action of lifting an object by supporting its weight, usually from underneath. For a plate, this is often achieved using the hand flat underneath or with fingers curled around the edge, which aligns closely with the Disk grasp.

The ""best"" grasp depends slightly on the task (e.g., simply picking up an empty plate vs. carrying a full one) and the specific hand configuration used, but the primary stable and load-bearing way to hold a plate aligns with the principles of the **Disk grasp** or a **Lifting grasp** as defined in Feix's taxonomy. These are classified as Power grasps because the focus is on securely supporting the object's weight."
data/plate/plate18.jpeg,"['extension type', 'palmar']",palmar,"Based on Feix's GRASP taxonomy, the best grasp for a plate, especially when carrying it with food, is typically a type of **Palmar Support** or specifically categorized as a **Plate Grasp** or **Dish Grasp** subtype.

Here's why:

1.  **Object Properties:** A plate is a relatively flat, rigid object. The primary function is to hold and transport food.
2.  **Task:** The most common task is carrying the plate, which requires stable support for the object and its contents.
3.  **Grasp Type (Feix Taxonomy):**
    *   **Palmar Support:** This involves the palm supporting the bulk of the object's weight from underneath, often with fingers wrapped around the edges (the rim of the plate) for stability. This provides a broad base of support necessary for flat, potentially heavy items.
    *   **Plate Grasp / Dish Grasp:** These are specific subtypes within the taxonomy designed for objects like plates or trays. They are essentially variations of palmar support tailored to the specific shape, where the hand is positioned underneath, supporting the flat surface, and fingers curl around the rim.

While you might lift an empty plate using a **Lateral Pinch** variant (grasping the edge with thumb and fingers), the **Palmar Support / Plate Grasp** is the most secure and functional grasp according to Feix's taxonomy for the primary use case of carrying a plate, particularly one loaded with food."
data/plate/plate28.png,"['extension type', 'palmar']",,"Based on Feix's grasp taxonomy, the best grasp for a paper plate is typically a **Plate grasp**.

This grasp involves supporting the flat surface of the plate on the palm and extended fingers, with the thumb often positioned on the rim to help stabilize the object. It is specifically designed for carrying or balancing flat, lightweight objects like plates."
data/plate/plate20.jpeg,"['extension type', 'palmar']",,"Based on Feix's GRASP taxonomy, the ""best"" grasp for the plate depends on the intended action. However, the most common and stable grasp for carrying a single plate like this involves supporting its weight from underneath.

A common and effective grasp for carrying a plate is:

1.  **Fingers:** Extended or slightly curved, placed underneath the plate to support its bottom surface (often along the radius or towards the center). This aligns with a **Supportive Grasp** or using **Parallel Extension** of the fingers underneath the object.
2.  **Thumb:** Placed on the top surface, usually on the rim, providing opposition and stabilization.

Within Feix's taxonomy, this type of interaction, where the hand supports a flat object from below with fingers while the thumb provides stability from above, is classified under **Supportive Grasps** or specific subcategories for flat objects like **Disc Grasps** or **Plate Grasps**, emphasizing the function of support and stabilization of a flat object.

It's not a typical power grasp (like cylindrical or spherical) or a simple precision grasp (like tip pinch). It's a specialized supportive grasp for a flat, often weighted, object.

Therefore, a suitable description based on Feix's taxonomy would be a **Supportive Grasp** for a flat object, characterized by fingers providing support underneath (often in parallel extension) and the thumb providing stabilization and opposition on the top surface/rim."
data/golf/golf7.jpeg,"['tripod', 'inferior pincer', 'quadpod']",tripod,"Based on Feix's GRASP taxonomy (The GRASP taxonomy of human grasp types. IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems), the object shown (a golf ball) is a small, spherical object.

For picking up, holding, or placing such a small spherical object where fine manipulation or precise placement is often involved, a common and effective grasp according to Feix's taxonomy would be a **Precision Grasp**.

More specifically, within Precision Grasps, a suitable type is the **Tripod Grasp** (also sometimes called Tridigital Pinch). This involves holding the object with the pads of the thumb, index finger, and middle finger, providing stability and control for small objects.

While other grasps are possible (like a full palmar grasp if just enclosing it, or a simple two-finger pinch), the Tripod grasp is highly typical and well-suited for securely handling a golf ball for tasks like picking it up off the grass or placing it on a tee."
data/golf/golf23.jpg,"['tripod', 'inferior pincer', 'quadpod']",palmar pinch,"Based on Feix's grasp taxonomy, the best grasp for a golf ball, given its size and the typical ways it's handled (picking up, placing, holding for putting), would be a **Precision Grasp**. More specifically, it would likely fall under one of these subtypes:

1.  **Palmar Pinch (3 fingers)** (P3.1) or **Palmar Pinch (4 fingers)** (P3.2): The thumb pad opposes the pads of the index and middle fingers (or more), providing good control over the small, spherical object.
2.  **Tripod** (P4.1) or **Quadpod** (P4.2): The thumb opposes the fingertips of the index and middle fingers (Tripod) or more (Quadpod). This is also very common for manipulating small spheres with precision.

Both Palmar Pinch and Tripod/Quadpod are very similar for an object like a golf ball, focusing on fingertip/pad opposition for control rather than using the full palm for power. **Palmar Pinch** or **Tripod** are the most likely specific types.

Choosing one ""best"" grasp depends on the specific action, but a **Palmar Pinch (3 fingers)** or **Tripod** are highly representative. Let's go with **Palmar Pinch** as it describes the pad-to-pad opposition well."
data/golf/golf1.jpg,"['tripod', 'inferior pincer', 'quadpod']",palmar,"Based on Feix's GRASP taxonomy, considering the typical actions involving a golf ball (picking it up, placing it on a tee, holding it):

1.  **Object Characteristics:** A golf ball is a small, hard, spherical object.
2.  **Task Consideration:** Handling a golf ball often involves picking it up from a surface (ground or tee), holding it, or placing it precisely.
3.  **Feix's Taxonomy:** Divides grasps into Power and Precision.

    *   **Power Grasps:** Aim for force and stability. Spherical grasp involves enclosing a sphere with the hand. While possible to hold a golf ball this way, it's generally too small for a full power spherical grasp, and this grasp isn't typically used for precise placement.
    *   **Precision Grasps:** Aim for manipulation and control.
        *   **Tip Grasp:** Involves holding the object between the tips of the thumb and one or more fingers (typically index and middle). This is commonly used for picking up small objects.
        *   **Palmar Grasp (Pinch Grasp):** Involves holding the object between the pad of the thumb and the pads of one or more fingers (typically index and middle, often called a 3-finger pinch or tripod grip). This provides more stability and control than a tip grasp for positioning or carrying.

Given that handling a golf ball often requires precise placement (e.g., on a tee) and stable holding, the **Precision Palmar Grasp (Pinch)** is arguably the best fit from Feix's taxonomy. Specifically, a 3-finger pinch (thumb pad against the pads of the index and middle fingers) is a very common and effective way to hold and manipulate a golf ball. The Precision Tip grasp is also a valid alternative for picking it up quickly.

However, for stable control and positioning, the **Precision Palmar (Pinch)** is generally preferred."
data/golf/golf5.jpg,"['tripod', 'inferior pincer', 'quadpod']",palmar pinch,"Based on Feix's grasp taxonomy, there isn't a single ""best"" grasp without a specific task defined. However, considering common interactions with a golf ball (like picking it up, placing it on a tee, or simply holding it), the relevant grasp types from Feix's taxonomy would be:

1.  **Precision Grasp (specifically a Pinch):** For tasks requiring dexterity and fine control, such as picking the ball up from the ground or placing it on a tee. This involves the opposition of the thumb and one or more fingers (e.g., Tip Pinch, Palmar Pinch, or Tripod Pinch). This is a very common way to interact with a small object like a golf ball.

2.  **Power Grasp (specifically a Spherical Grasp):** For simply holding the ball securely in the palm. This involves the fingers and palm conforming to the spherical shape of the ball.

Given the image shows the ball on the grass, tasks like picking it up or placing it are implied, making a **Precision Grasp (Pinch)** highly appropriate. A **Spherical Grasp** is also a valid way to hold it once acquired.

Without a specific task, both are plausible. However, if we consider the initial interaction or manipulation tasks often associated with the ball's position on the ground, a **Pinch** is often the most functional ""best"" grasp for control and dexterity."
data/golf/golf20.jpg,"['tripod', 'inferior pincer', 'quadpod']",,"Based on Feix's GRASP taxonomy, the best grasp for the object in the image (a small, light, spherical golf ball) is most likely a **Precision Grasp**, specifically a **Pad Grasp (Pad-to-Pad Grasp)**.

Here's why:

1.  **Object Properties:** The object is small, spherical, and relatively light.
2.  **Task (Implied):** The most common task involving picking up such an object from a surface is handling, placing, or throwing it, requiring precision rather than brute force.
3.  **Feix's Taxonomy:**
    *   **Power Grasps** are typically used for larger, heavier objects where stability and force are needed (e.g., Cylindrical Power, Spherical Power). A golf ball doesn't require this.
    *   **Precision Grasps** are used for manipulating small objects, where control is more important than force.
    *   Among precision grasps, the **Pad Grasp** (often called a pincer grip) involves the pads of the fingers (typically index and thumb, or index, middle, and thumb) opposing each other. This is ideal for grasping a small, spherical object securely for manipulation or lifting.

Therefore, the **Pad Grasp (Precision Grasp)** is the most appropriate classification according to Feix's taxonomy for handling a golf ball."
data/golf/golf19.jpg,"['tripod', 'inferior pincer', 'quadpod']",power sphere,"Based on Feix's grasp taxonomy, the best grasp for a golf ball would be the **Sphere Grasp**.

Here's why:

1.  **Object Shape:** The object is spherical. Feix's taxonomy includes a specific category for handling spherical objects.
2.  **Object Size:** A golf ball is a relatively small sphere (typically 42-43mm diameter). While it could potentially be held in other ways (like a multi-finger pinch), the ""Sphere Grasp"" is specifically designed for objects of this shape.
3.  **Grasp Characteristics:** The Sphere Grasp typically involves the thumb opposing multiple fingers (index, middle, and often ring and pinky) which conform to the spherical shape of the object, allowing for stable holding and manipulation. This is how people commonly pick up and hold a golf ball.

Power Sphere grasp is used for larger spheres (like a basketball), while simple pinches (Tip, Pad, Palmar/Tripod) are generally used for smaller objects or those requiring fine manipulation rather than just holding. The Sphere Grasp is the most appropriate general grasp for an object like a golf ball within this taxonomy."
