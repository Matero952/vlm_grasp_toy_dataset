This falls under the category of **Power Grasps**, specifically the **Power Spherical Grasp**.

Here's why:

1.  **Object Shape:** A tennis ball is a spherical object.
2.  **Grasp Mechanism:** The Spherical Grasp involves the fingers and thumb wrapping around the curved surface of the object, often with the palm also in contact, to enclose it securely.
3.  **Function:** This grasp provides stability and allows for the application of force (power), which is necessary for actions like holding, throwing, or bouncing a tennis ball.

data/cd/cd2.jpg,"['power disk', 'precision disk']",tripod,"Based on Feix's 2009 grasp taxonomy:

The object is a thin, flat, light disc. Handling it typically involves careful manipulation to avoid damage or smudging the data surface. This primary function indicates a **Precision Grasp**, as opposed to a Power Grasp used for stability or applying force.

Among the specific precision grasps described by Feix:

1.  **Tripod Grasp / Quadpod Grasp:** Used for manipulating small objects (like pens) with 3 or 4 fingers and the thumb. A CD is too large for these.
2.  **Palm Pinch:** Pinching the object against the palm. Possible but not the most common or stable way to hold a CD.
3.  **Tip Pinch:** Object pinched between the fingertips of the thumb and one or more fingers. This describes a common way to pick up or hold a CD by its edge (thumb on top, fingers underneath).

While the most common and recommended way to handle a CD is often by placing fingers through the central hole and supporting it with the thumb on top, this specific action doesn't neatly fit into one of the standard named grasps in Feix's primary list (like Tip Pinch, Tripod, etc.). However, this method is also clearly a **Precision Grasp** due to the need for careful control.

Considering the standard named grasps available in the taxonomy and a common method of handling the CD precisely by its edge, the **Tip Pinch** is the most applicable specific grasp name from Feix's classification.

Therefore, the best grasp category is Precision Grasp, and a specific named grasp applicable to handling a CD (by its edge) is the **Tip Pinch**.

The most appropriate category of grasp for this object is a **Precision Grasp**.

Within Precision Grasps, which are characterized by holding the object away from the palm using the tips or pads of the fingers and thumb for manipulation and control, the common and best grasp for a DVD would be:

1.  **A Grasp Utilizing the Central Aperture:** This is arguably the safest and most common method when inserting or removing the disc. It involves inserting one finger (typically the index or middle finger) through the central hole of the disc and using the thumb (and potentially other fingers) on the outer edge or bottom surface of the disc to support and control it. This keeps fingers entirely off the sensitive data surface.

While another method is holding the disc around the edge with the thumb and opposing fingers (a form of **Disk Grasp**, which is a type of precision grasp), the method using the central hole minimizes the risk of touching the data area.

Therefore, the best grasp based on functionality and avoiding damage, fitting within Feix's Precision Grasp category, is the one **utilizing the central aperture with opposing thumb support on the edge/surface**. This is a specialized form of Precision Grasp for handling flat, circular objects with a hole."

data/cd/cd20.jpg,"['power disk', 'precision disk']",lateral,"Based on Feix's 2016 GRASP taxonomy and considering the typical ways humans handle a thin, flat, circular object like a CD for manipulation (e.g., inserting into a player, placing in a case), the most appropriate grasp falls under the **Precision Grasp** category.

Specifically, two very common and suitable precision grasps for a CD are:

1.  **Disk (Pad Opposition):** This involves using the pads of the thumb and one or more fingers to grasp the disk along its outer edge. This provides good control for picking up, placing, or inserting the CD.
2.  **Lateral Pinch (Pad-to-Side):** This involves holding the CD between the pad of the thumb and the side of the index finger. This is a very common way to carry or hand over a CD.

While both are excellent candidates and widely used, the **Disk (Pad Opposition)** grasp (Subtype 1.6 in Feix's taxonomy) is arguably the most representative ""manipulative"" grasp for tasks like inserting a CD into a drive, which requires control around the edge. The **Lateral Pinch** (Subtype 1.10) is equally valid and very common for simpler handling like carrying.

Therefore, based on the object's properties and typical manipulation needs, the best grasp is most likely a **Precision Grasp**, specifically the **Disk (Pad Opposition)** or **Lateral Pinch** subtype. The ""Disk (Pad Opposition)"" is a strong candidate as it is specifically named for this type of object and grasp."
data/cd/cd9.jpg,"['power disk', 'precision disk']",,"Based on Feix's grasp taxonomy, the best grasp for handling a disc like the one shown is typically a **Disc** grasp.

Specifically, this falls under the **Precision Grasp / Pad Opposition** category. Common variations for a disc are:

*   **Disc 3-finger:** Thumb opposing the index and middle fingers on the edge of the disc.
*   **Disc 4-finger:** Thumb opposing the index, middle, and ring fingers on the edge of the disc.

These grasps allow holding the disc by its edge, avoiding contact with the data surface. While a different grasp might be used (like putting a finger through the center hole and supporting the edge, which might relate to a variation of a Lumbrical or Plate grasp in some taxonomies), Feix's taxonomy explicitly includes ""Disc"" grasps tailored for this type of object held by the edge."

2.  **G14 - Plate Grasp:** This grasp involves the thumb opposing the fingers around the edge of a flat object. This is also a common way to hold a CD/DVD, gripping it by its outer rim with the thumb on top and fingers underneath.

Both the **Disc Grasp (G13)** and the **Plate Grasp (G14)** are suitable for this object, as they are specifically defined for handling flat, disc-like objects. The choice between the two might depend on the specific task (e.g., inserting into a drive vs. handing it to someone). However, they fall under the category of grasps for handling flat objects.

Considering the stability provided by supporting the surface, the **Disc Grasp (G13)** which spans the object's surface is often considered a primary method for handling CDs/DVDs securely to prevent bending."
data/cd/cd3.jpg,"['power disk', 'precision disk']",,"Based on Feix's GRASP taxonomy, the best grasp for a CD/DVD is a **Precision Grasp**.

Here's why:

1.  **Object Properties:** The CD is a thin, flat, light object with a sensitive surface (the data side) that should not be touched. Handling requires control and care, not force.
2.  **Typical Handling:** CDs are typically held by the edges with the thumb and fingers, or by placing a finger through the central hole while supporting the other side. Both methods avoid touching the data surface.
3.  **Feix Taxonomy Fit:**
    *   **Power Grasp:** Not suitable, as the object is light and doesn't require force.
    *   **Precision Grasp:** This category involves using the fingertips and thumb for fine manipulation and control. Holding the CD by the edge with opposing thumb and fingers (a form of pulp or pad opposition grasp applied to a thin edge) fits perfectly into the Precision Grasp definition. The alternative of putting a finger through the hole and supporting the other side also relies on fingertip/pad control, aligning with precision principles.

The most common and stable way to hold a CD described within the general types of Feix's taxonomy is by the edges using finger and thumb pads for controlled manipulation, which falls under the **Precision Grasp** category."
data/cd/cd22.jpeg,"['power disk', 'precision disk']",,"Based on the image showing a CD and considering typical human interaction with this object, the most common and arguably ""best"" grasp for stable handling and manipulation (like inserting into a drive) aligns best with a specific type of **Intermediate Grip** within Feix's GRASP taxonomy.

Here's the breakdown:

1.  **Object Analysis:** The object is a flat, thin, light disc with a central hole. Its primary uses involve transport, insertion, and removal. Applying significant force *with* or *to* the object is rare during typical handling. Stability and control to avoid scratching are key.

2.  **Typical ""Best"" Grasp:** The most secure and functional way humans typically grasp a CD for handling is by putting the **thumb through the central hole** and supporting the disc's underside with the **fingers** (usually index and middle, or multiple fingers). This grip provides excellent stability, allows for precise positioning, and minimizes contact with the data surface.

3.  **Mapping to Feix's Taxonomy:**
    *   **Power Grips:** These involve full palm enclosure and force transmission (e.g., cylindrical, spherical). The CD grip doesn't fit this description as the palm is not enclosing the object for applying force.
    *   **Precision Grips:** These involve using fingertips or pads for fine manipulation or pinching small objects. While the CD grip requires control, it involves a larger part of the hand supporting a larger, flat object, rather than manipulating a small feature with fingertips.
    *   **Intermediate Grips:** This category includes grips for objects that don't fit neatly into power or precision, often involving flat objects, carrying, or specific tool handling. The CD grip fits well here. It's about stable handling and transport of a light, flat object.

4.  **Specific Grip within Intermediate:** Within Feix's 33 grips, this specific configuration (thumb through hole, fingers supporting underside) is sometimes considered a variant or example falling under or related to:
    *   **G19 - Flat Pinch:** This involves thumb opposing fingers on a flat surface. The CD grip is structurally similar, with the thumb on one ""side"" (through the hole) opposing fingers on the other ""side"" (the underside surface). However, the thumb's position *in the hole* is a defining feature not perfectly captured by a generic ""Flat Pinch"" description which might imply pinching the edge or flat surface without using a hole.
    *   **G27 - Plate Grip:** This is described as holding a plate horizontally. While the object is different, the *purpose* (stable horizontal carrying of a flat object) is similar. However, the *mechanism* (thumb through hole vs. fingers curled under rim) is different.

Given the commonality and stability of the thumb-through-the-hole grip for a CD, and its function focused on stable handling of a flat, light object rather than high force or intricate fingertip manipulation, it is best classified as a specific application or variation within the **Intermediate Grip** category. While not always listed as a standalone named grip like ""CD Grip"" in all versions of the taxonomy, its characteristics align most closely with this category, specifically resembling a functional blend of a Flat Pinch for a holed object designed for stable carrying like a Plate.

Therefore, the best grasp for this object, according to the principles of Feix's taxonomy, is a variation of an **Intermediate Grip**, characterized by the thumb placed through the central hole opposing fingers supporting the underside."
data/cd/cd4.jpg,"['power disk', 'precision disk']",,"Based on Feix's GRASP taxonomy, the object is a disk. The most suitable grasp type for holding and manipulating a disk-shaped object like a CD or DVD is the **Disk grasp**.

This grasp is characterized by applying opposing forces to the flat surfaces of the disk, typically using the thumb on one side and one or more fingers on the other, or using the central hole for stabilization. It's primarily used for manipulation tasks like inserting the disk into a drive, labeling it, or simple transport."
data/cd/cd10.jpg,"['power disk', 'precision disk']",precision disk,"Based on Feix's grasp taxonomy and considering the properties of a DVD (thin, flat, circular object requiring careful handling), several grasp types are relevant. The ""best"" grasp can depend on the specific task (e.g., picking up, inserting into a drive, placing in a case).

However, considering a general, careful way to handle the object, the following are strong candidates:

1.  **Precision Disk Grasp:** Holding the flat object with fingertips. This is a common way to handle a DVD carefully, either by the edges or by placing fingertips on the non-data side, often used when picking it up, examining it, or placing it into a case or drive slot without touching the sensitive data surface.
2.  **Lateral Pinch:** Holding the object's edge between the thumb and the side of the index finger. This is a very common and functional grasp specifically used for inserting the DVD into a drive or slot.

Given the ambiguity of ""best"" without a specific task, and the image showing the entire disk without a hand or context of use, both Precision Disk Grasp and Lateral Pinch are highly relevant. Precision Disk covers a more general careful handling using fingertips, while Lateral Pinch is specific to edge manipulation during insertion.

The image itself highlights the surface and the edge, supporting both possibilities. However, if we consider a grasp for careful general handling, **Precision Disk Grasp** seems a strong fit as it describes holding the flat object with fingertips, which is crucial for avoiding damage and maintaining control. Lateral Pinch is perhaps more specific to the act of insertion.

Therefore, based on the object's nature and typical careful handling, a strong candidate for a ""best"" grasp type is the **Precision Disk Grasp**.

In this grasp, the CD is held by its edge between the pad of the thumb and the side or pads of one or more fingers (typically the index and/or middle fingers). This allows for stable control and manipulation of the thin, flat disc.

Another possible grasp, especially for carrying, could be the **Plate/Pad** grasp, where the flat object is supported by the palm and fingers from underneath and held down by the thumb on top. However, the **Lateral** grasp is often preferred for manipulation tasks as it minimizes touching the sensitive surfaces of the CD.

Considering typical interaction with a CD, the **Lateral** grasp provides excellent control and protects the read surface, making it arguably the most appropriate ""best"" grasp for general handling and manipulation from the taxonomy."

This involves opposing the thumb pad against the pad of one or more fingers (typically the index finger) to grip the edge of the disc.

This avoids touching the data surface and provides a secure hold.

In Feix's taxonomy, this specific grasp is often classified under a category for handling objects with holes or as a specific type of **Disk Grasp**. It leverages both the flat shape and the presence of the central hole.

data/cd/cd14.jpg,"['power disk', 'precision disk']",,"Based on Feix's grasp taxonomy and considering how people typically handle a CD delicately while avoiding the data surface, especially for tasks like insertion, the grasp using the center hole is a common and effective method.

Examining the specific grasp types listed in Feix's taxonomy:
-   The ""Ring grasp"" is described as ""The object is held by inserting fingers through the hole and opposing them with the thumb on the outside (e.g. a ring, a donut).""
A CD is a thin, flat disc with a central hole, essentially functioning as a large, thin ring in terms of how it's held using the hole. The common ""CD grasp"" involves putting a finger (usually index or middle) through the hole and opposing it with the thumb on the edge or underside. This aligns well with the description of the ""Ring grasp"".

This grasp allows for precise manipulation and carrying, fitting within the general category of precision tasks, although ""Ring grasp"" is a specific named grasp within the taxonomy rather than a top-level category.

Therefore, the best grasp for a CD based on Feix's taxonomy, particularly considering the common method utilizing the central hole (hinted at by the crops), is the **Ring grasp**.

data/cd/cd11.jpg,"['power disk', 'precision disk']",lateral,"Based on Feix's GRASP taxonomy and considering the typical and safest way to handle a CD/DVD to avoid damaging the data surface, the best grasp is one that utilizes the center hole for support while optionally providing stability on the outer edge.

This type of grasp involves inserting a finger (typically the index or middle finger) through the center hole of the disc and supporting the edge with the thumb and/or other fingers. The primary function is to **support** the disc's weight and allow it to be moved or placed without touching the sensitive data area.

Within Feix's taxonomy:

1.  It is **not a Power Grasp:** Power grasps are designed for applying force or securely holding heavy objects (e.g., Cylinder, Sphere, Hook, Plate/Lateral Power). A CD is light and doesn't require force.
2.  It is **not a typical Precision Grasp:** Precision grasps are for fine manipulation of small objects using fingertips (e.g., Tip, Palmar/Tripod, Lateral/Key Pinch). While the outer edge might be held with fingertips/thumb, the primary support comes from the finger in the hole, and the manipulation isn't ""fine manipulation"" of the disc itself but rather positioning it.
3.  It best fits into the category of a **Support Grasp** or an **Intermediate Grasp**. While ""Support Grasp"" isn't always listed as a primary prehensile category in some simplified versions of taxonomies, Feix's paper discusses functional categories like support. This grasp uses the hand to support the object's weight and structure, taking advantage of the object's specific geometry (the hole).

Therefore, the best grasp for a CD/DVD, according to the function and common handling method, is best described as a **Support Grasp** or an **Intermediate Grasp** that leverages the center hole and outer edge for stable, non-damaging handling."
data/cd/cd12.jpeg,"['power disk', 'precision disk']",tripod,"Based on Feix's GRASP taxonomy, the ""best"" grasp for a CD/DVD depends on the specific task being performed, as the taxonomy classifies grasps by function and form. However, considering the common ways humans interact with a single CD for its primary purpose (handling, inserting, removing), two main types come to mind that fit within Feix's classification:

1.  **Precision Grasp - Pinch Grasp (2- or 3-Finger Pinch) on the Edge:**
    *   **Description:** This is perhaps the most common and recommended way to handle a CD. The disk is held by its outer edge using the thumb and one or two fingers (typically index or index and middle finger). The contact is made on the non-data side of the edge.
    *   **Why it fits:** This is a *Precision Grasp* because it involves using the fingertips or pads for fine manipulation (guiding into a drive, picking up without touching the surface). It's a specific type of *Pinch Grasp* as the object is held between the thumb and opposing fingers without significant palm involvement for stability or power. It allows for controlled movement and avoids touching the data surface, which is crucial for this object.

2.  **Precision Grasp - Variant using the Center Hole (Often combined with Edge/Underside Support):**
    *   **Description:** The index finger is placed through the center hole, and the disk is supported or stabilized with the thumb and/or other fingers on the outer edge or underside.
    *   **Why it fits (conceptually):** While Feix's taxonomy primarily focuses on how the *outer shape* of an object is gripped, this method is highly characteristic of handling a CD, especially when placing it on a spindle drive or lifting it from a flat surface without sliding. It's a form of *precision manipulation* leveraging a specific feature of the object. The overall goal is precision placement and avoiding the data surface, aligning with the *Precision Grasp* category's purpose, even if it's a specific object-dependent variation not explicitly named as a standard pinch or tripod. The support on the edge or underside often still involves a pinch-like action or finger pad contact for control.

Other grasps might be used for different tasks (e.g., a **Plate Grasp** - a type of Power Grasp - could be used to carry a stack of CDs, supporting them from underneath with an open hand), but for handling a *single* CD as depicted for typical use, the **Precision Pinch on the Edge** and the **Center Hole supported Precision Grasp** are the most appropriate and frequently observed grasps aligning with Feix's classification principles.

The most ""best"" or typical *protective* grasp for a single CD is the **Precision Pinch Grasp on the Edge**, as it directly supports the object while keeping potentially damaging contact away from the data surface."
data/cd/cd13.jpeg,"['power disk', 'precision disk']",,"Based on Feix's GRASP taxonomy (Feix et al., 2009), the most appropriate and common grasp for a CD or DVD is a type of **Precision Grasp**.

1.  Placing the **thumb through the central hole**.
2.  Supporting the disc from the opposite side (often the edge or the underside near the edge) with one or more **fingers** (usually index and middle fingers).

This grip is classified as a Precision Grasp because it allows for careful manipulation (like inserting into a drive or preventing scratches) and doesn't rely on power or full hand wrap. It's a specialized grip adapted to the specific geometry and handling requirements of a disc with a hole."
data/cd/cd7.jpg,"['power disk', 'precision disk']",tripod,"Based on Feix's grasp taxonomy, the object (a CD) is a flat, thin disk that is relatively light and requires careful handling to avoid damaging the surface. Therefore, the appropriate grasp type would fall under the category of **Precision Grasps**, rather than Power Grasps.

Within the Precision Grasps, the most suitable methods for handling a CD typically involve:

1.  **Holding the edge:** This usually involves using the pads of the thumb and one or more fingers (index, middle) on opposite sides of the edge of the disk. This fits well with the description of a **Pad Pinch** or potentially a variant of a **Prismatic** grasp if holding with multiple fingers on one side, but **Pad Pinch** is a strong candidate for holding the thin edge between thumb and finger pads.
2.  **Using the center hole:** A common method is to place a finger (like the index or middle finger) through the center hole and stabilize the disk with the thumb and/or other fingers on the edge. While not a primary named category like ""Tripod"" or ""Pinch"" in the simplified Feix list, this is a highly functional **Precision Grasp** specifically adapted for this object's geometry, allowing excellent control and avoiding surface contact. It could be considered a specialized type of precision manipulation grasp.

Considering the need for control, stability, and avoiding surface contact, both methods are suitable precision grasps. However, the act of holding the *edge* between the thumb and finger pads is a direct mapping to a defined type in Feix's taxonomy:

The best grasp based on Feix's taxonomy for carefully handling a CD by its edge is a **Pad Pinch**, which is a type of **Precision Grasp**. While the ""finger through hole"" method is also a common precision technique for this object, the edge-holding method corresponds more directly to the explicitly named ""Pad Pinch"" type in the taxonomy for holding flat, thin objects by their edges with control."

*   **Support:** The hand and fingers are used to support the flat surface of the plate from underneath, holding it against gravity and keeping it stable. You might also use your thumb on the rim for added stability, but the core action is support rather than a power or precision grip on the object itself.

Other grasp types from the taxonomy (Power, Precision, Intermediate) are generally not suitable for the primary function and form factor of a paper plate.

For lifting a flat, relatively light object like a paper plate from a surface, the most appropriate grasp from Feix's taxonomy is likely the **Friction Lift**, which is a sub-type of the **Lifting** category.

*   **Friction Lift:** In this grasp, you slide fingers (and potentially the palm) underneath the flat object and use friction between the hand and the object's surface to lift it. This fits perfectly for how one would typically pick up a paper plate lying flat on a table.

Once the plate is lifted and held, especially if it contains food, the grasp might transition into a different type, often involving **Support** where the hand is placed flat underneath the plate to cradle it, which Feix's taxonomy would likely classify under **Non-Prehensile Interactions** or **Support grasps**, as the object is resting *on* the hand rather than firmly grasped *by* it.

2.  **Action:** When picking up a plate lying flat, you typically extend your fingers and thumb relatively parallel to each other across the surface of the plate to lift it. The palm may or may not be in full contact depending on the specific hand/plate size, but the fingers and thumb provide the primary opposing forces for the lift.
3.  **Taxonomy Fit:** Feix's definition of the Parallel Extension grasp includes using extended fingers and thumb opposing each other across a flat object, with the palm potentially in contact. Examples often include grasping books, trays, or tablets, which are similar in form factor to a plate in this context.

This perfectly describes how one typically holds a plate (e.g., supporting it from underneath with the palm and fingers spread, or gripping the edges with fingers underneath and thumb on top).

2.  **Precision Grasps:** Used for manipulation and control with fingertips. These are not suitable for stably supporting or carrying a plate.

Therefore, according to Feix's GRASP taxonomy, the best grasp for a plate is likely the **Disk Grasp**, which falls under the **Power Grasp** category. This grasp provides the necessary stability and support for handling a flat, circular object like a plate."

Here's why:

1.  **Object Shape:** The object is flat and relatively large.
2.  **Task:** The common tasks involving grasping a plate are carrying, supporting, or holding it steady.
3.  **Feix's Taxonomy:** Feix et al. classify grasps based on hand posture and contact points. The ""Platform grasp"" (also sometimes referred to as a ""Tabletop grasp"" or a type of ""support grasp"") is specifically described for holding objects from underneath, resting on the palm and/or fingers. In this grasp, the hand acts as a stable base, and there is minimal opposition between the thumb and fingers required specifically to hold the object against gravity (though fingers may curl slightly around the edge for stability).

While other grasps might be used in specific situations (like a side grasp with thumb on the rim and fingers underneath, which could be a variation), the Platform grasp is a fundamental way to support a flat object like a plate from below, aligning well with Feix's definition of using the hand as a support surface."

The Support grasp is used when the primary function is to bear the weight of the object, typically from underneath, using the fingers and palm or a combination thereof, often with a large contact area. This aligns perfectly with how one holds a plate to prevent its contents from falling."
data/plate/plate15.jpeg,"['extension type', 'palmar']",,"Based on Feix's GRASP taxonomy, the most suitable grasps for handling a plate like the one shown (a flat, rigid, disk-like object) typically fall under the **Power Grasps** category, specifically:

It involves supporting the object from underneath with the palm and/or fingers, often with the fingers curled around the edge for stability. This provides a secure hold suitable for carrying weight.

2.  **Lifting Grasp:** While more general, this describes the action of lifting an object by supporting its weight, usually from underneath. For a plate, this is often achieved using the hand flat underneath or with fingers curled around the edge, which aligns closely with the Disk grasp.

The ""best"" grasp depends slightly on the task (e.g., simply picking up an empty plate vs. carrying a full one) and the specific hand configuration used, but the primary stable and load-bearing way to hold a plate aligns with the principles of the **Disk grasp** or a **Lifting grasp** as defined in Feix's taxonomy. These are classified as Power grasps because the focus is on securely supporting the object's weight."

1.  **Object Properties:** A plate is a relatively flat, rigid object. The primary function is to hold and transport food.
2.  **Task:** The most common task is carrying the plate, which requires stable support for the object and its contents.
3.  **Grasp Type (Feix Taxonomy):**
    *   **Palmar Support:** This involves the palm supporting the bulk of the object's weight from underneath, often with fingers wrapped around the edges (the rim of the plate) for stability. This provides a broad base of support necessary for flat, potentially heavy items.
    *   **Plate Grasp / Dish Grasp:** These are specific subtypes within the taxonomy designed for objects like plates or trays. They are essentially variations of palmar support tailored to the specific shape, where the hand is positioned underneath, supporting the flat surface, and fingers curl around the rim.

While you might lift an empty plate using a **Lateral Pinch** variant (grasping the edge with thumb and fingers), the **Palmar Support / Plate Grasp** is the most secure and functional grasp according to Feix's taxonomy for the primary use case of carrying a plate, particularly one loaded with food."

A common and effective grasp for carrying a plate is:

1.  **Fingers:** Extended or slightly curved, placed underneath the plate to support its bottom surface (often along the radius or towards the center). This aligns with a **Supportive Grasp** or using **Parallel Extension** of the fingers underneath the object.
2.  **Thumb:** Placed on the top surface, usually on the rim, providing opposition and stabilization.

Within Feix's taxonomy, this type of interaction, where the hand supports a flat object from below with fingers while the thumb provides stability from above, is classified under **Supportive Grasps** or specific subcategories for flat objects like **Disc Grasps** or **Plate Grasps**, emphasizing the function of support and stabilization of a flat object.

It's not a typical power grasp (like cylindrical or spherical) or a simple precision grasp (like tip pinch). It's a specialized supportive grasp for a flat, often weighted, object.

Therefore, a suitable description based on Feix's taxonomy would be a **Supportive Grasp** for a flat object, characterized by fingers providing support underneath (often in parallel extension) and the thumb providing stabilization and opposition on the top surface/rim."

For picking up, holding, or placing such a small spherical object where fine manipulation or precise placement is often involved, a common and effective grasp according to Feix's taxonomy would be a **Precision Grasp**.

More specifically, within Precision Grasps, a suitable type is the **Tripod Grasp** (also sometimes called Tridigital Pinch). This involves holding the object with the pads of the thumb, index finger, and middle finger, providing stability and control for small objects.

While other grasps are possible (like a full palmar grasp if just enclosing it, or a simple two-finger pinch), the Tripod grasp is highly typical and well-suited for securely handling a golf ball for tasks like picking it up off the grass or placing it on a tee."
data/golf/golf23.jpg,"['tripod', 'inferior pincer', 'quadpod']",palmar pinch,"Based on Feix's grasp taxonomy, the best grasp for a golf ball, given its size and the typical ways it's handled (picking up, placing, holding for putting), would be a **Precision Grasp**. More specifically, it would likely fall under one of these subtypes:

1.  **Palmar Pinch (3 fingers)** (P3.1) or **Palmar Pinch (4 fingers)** (P3.2): The thumb pad opposes the pads of the index and middle fingers (or more), providing good control over the small, spherical object.
2.  **Tripod** (P4.1) or **Quadpod** (P4.2): The thumb opposes the fingertips of the index and middle fingers (Tripod) or more (Quadpod). This is also very common for manipulating small spheres with precision.

Both Palmar Pinch and Tripod/Quadpod are very similar for an object like a golf ball, focusing on fingertip/pad opposition for control rather than using the full palm for power. **Palmar Pinch** or **Tripod** are the most likely specific types.

Choosing one ""best"" grasp depends on the specific action, but a **Palmar Pinch (3 fingers)** or **Tripod** are highly representative. Let's go with **Palmar Pinch** as it describes the pad-to-pad opposition well."
data/golf/golf1.jpg,"['tripod', 'inferior pincer', 'quadpod']",palmar,"Based on Feix's GRASP taxonomy, considering the typical actions involving a golf ball (picking it up, placing it on a tee, holding it):

1.  **Object Characteristics:** A golf ball is a small, hard, spherical object.
2.  **Task Consideration:** Handling a golf ball often involves picking it up from a surface (ground or tee), holding it, or placing it precisely.
3.  **Feix's Taxonomy:** Divides grasps into Power and Precision.

    *   **Power Grasps:** Aim for force and stability. Spherical grasp involves enclosing a sphere with the hand. While possible to hold a golf ball this way, it's generally too small for a full power spherical grasp, and this grasp isn't typically used for precise placement.
    *   **Precision Grasps:** Aim for manipulation and control.
        *   **Tip Grasp:** Involves holding the object between the tips of the thumb and one or more fingers (typically index and middle). This is commonly used for picking up small objects.
        *   **Palmar Grasp (Pinch Grasp):** Involves holding the object between the pad of the thumb and the pads of one or more fingers (typically index and middle, often called a 3-finger pinch or tripod grip). This provides more stability and control than a tip grasp for positioning or carrying.

Given that handling a golf ball often requires precise placement (e.g., on a tee) and stable holding, the **Precision Palmar Grasp (Pinch)** is arguably the best fit from Feix's taxonomy. Specifically, a 3-finger pinch (thumb pad against the pads of the index and middle fingers) is a very common and effective way to hold and manipulate a golf ball. The Precision Tip grasp is also a valid alternative for picking it up quickly.

data/golf/golf5.jpg,"['tripod', 'inferior pincer', 'quadpod']",palmar pinch,"Based on Feix's grasp taxonomy, there isn't a single ""best"" grasp without a specific task defined. However, considering common interactions with a golf ball (like picking it up, placing it on a tee, or simply holding it), the relevant grasp types from Feix's taxonomy would be:

1.  **Precision Grasp (specifically a Pinch):** For tasks requiring dexterity and fine control, such as picking the ball up from the ground or placing it on a tee. This involves the opposition of the thumb and one or more fingers (e.g., Tip Pinch, Palmar Pinch, or Tripod Pinch). This is a very common way to interact with a small object like a golf ball.

2.  **Power Grasp (specifically a Spherical Grasp):** For simply holding the ball securely in the palm. This involves the fingers and palm conforming to the spherical shape of the ball.

Given the image shows the ball on the grass, tasks like picking it up or placing it are implied, making a **Precision Grasp (Pinch)** highly appropriate. A **Spherical Grasp** is also a valid way to hold it once acquired.

Without a specific task, both are plausible. However, if we consider the initial interaction or manipulation tasks often associated with the ball's position on the ground, a **Pinch** is often the most functional ""best"" grasp for control and dexterity."

2.  **Task (Implied):** The most common task involving picking up such an object from a surface is handling, placing, or throwing it, requiring precision rather than brute force.
3.  **Feix's Taxonomy:**
    *   **Power Grasps** are typically used for larger, heavier objects where stability and force are needed (e.g., Cylindrical Power, Spherical Power). A golf ball doesn't require this.
    *   **Precision Grasps** are used for manipulating small objects, where control is more important than force.
    *   Among precision grasps, the **Pad Grasp** (often called a pincer grip) involves the pads of the fingers (typically index and thumb, or index, middle, and thumb) opposing each other. This is ideal for grasping a small, spherical object securely for manipulation or lifting.

3.  **Grasp Characteristics:** The Sphere Grasp typically involves the thumb opposing multiple fingers (index, middle, and often ring and pinky) which conform to the spherical shape of the object, allowing for stable holding and manipulation. This is how people commonly pick up and hold a golf ball.

Power Sphere grasp is used for larger spheres (like a basketball), while simple pinches (Tip, Pad, Palmar/Tripod) are generally used for smaller objects or those requiring fine manipulation rather than just holding.

While a **Power Spherical Grasp** (using the entire hand to enclose the ball firmly) is possible, it's less common or necessary for typical golf-related handling of the ball itself.

More likely and functional grasps for a golf ball in typical scenarios would be:

1.  **Precision Grasps:** Specifically, **Pad Grasps**.
    *   **3-finger Pad Grasp (Tripod Grasp):** Using the pads (pulps) of the thumb, index, and middle fingers. This is a very common grasp for picking up and manipulating small objects with dexterity.
    *   **N-finger Pad Grasp:** Using the pads of the thumb and multiple fingers (more than two) to cradle the ball.

2.  **Intermediate Grasps:**
    *   **Intermediate Spherical:** This often involves holding a sphere with fingers wrapped around it, but with less palm involvement than a full power grasp, allowing for more controlled holding and manipulation.

Considering the common ways a golfer interacts with the ball (picking it up from the ground or cup, placing it on a tee, taking it out of a pocket), grasps that allow for control and fine placement are most suitable. The **Tripod Grasp** (a type of Precision Pad Grasp) or an **Intermediate Spherical Grasp** would be excellent candidates according to Feix's taxonomy for handling an object like a golf ball.

1.  **Precision Sphere Grasp:** Using the pads of the thumb and multiple fingers (typically 2-4) to cup and manipulate the object. This provides good control and stability for a sphere.
2.  **Palmar Pinch:** Using the pad of the thumb against the pad(s) of one or more fingers (usually index and/or middle finger). This is a common and effective way to pick up and hold a small sphere with dexterity.

While a Power Sphere Grasp (enclosing the object with the full palm and fingers) is also possible, it is typically used for applying force or holding the object securely without requiring fine manipulation. For most tasks involving a golf ball, a precision grasp offers better control.

Therefore, the **Precision Sphere Grasp** or a **Palmar Pinch** are the best grasps for a golf ball according to Feix's taxonomy, depending on whether multiple fingers or just 1-2 fingers are used in opposition to the thumb. The Precision Sphere Grasp is perhaps the most specifically named grasp for this object type requiring dexterity."
data/golf/golf6.jpeg,"['tripod', 'inferior pincer', 'quadpod']",,"Based on Feix's GRASP taxonomy and considering the object (a golf ball) and the implicit task (picking it up from the ground), the best grasp would typically be a **Pinch grasp**.

Here's why:

1.  **Object Properties:** A golf ball is a small, hard, spherical object.
2.  **Task:** Picking it up from a surface (the ground).
3.  **Feix's Taxonomy:** The taxonomy distinguishes between Power and Precision grasps.
    *   **Power grasps** emphasize stability and force (e.g., Spherical, Cylindrical, Hook). While a Spherical grasp is possible, it might be less controlled and harder to execute neatly from the ground than a Pinch.
    *   **Precision grasps** emphasize manipulation and fine control (e.g., Tip, Pinch). A Pinch grasp uses the opposing forces of the thumb and one or more fingers (usually fingertips) to secure the object.

For a small object like a golf ball on a surface, a Pinch grasp (often a 2-finger or 3-finger pinch using the pads or tips of the thumb and index/middle fingers) provides sufficient control and stability for lifting it without needing to fully enclose it with the palm, which can be awkward when the object is on a flat surface.

Therefore, a **Pinch grasp** is the most appropriate classification from Feix's taxonomy for picking up a golf ball like this."
data/golf/golf11.jpg,"['tripod', 'inferior pincer', 'quadpod']",,"Based on Feix's GRASP taxonomy, the best grasp for a golf ball, considering its size, shape (spherical), and typical handling (precision placement, not forceful gripping), would fall under the **Precision Grasps** category.

Specifically, the most appropriate grasp type is the **Spherical Precision** grasp.

This grasp involves using the finger pads and thumb pad to conform to the spherical shape, allowing for controlled manipulation and placement of the object. While a power grasp (like a Spherical Power grasp) could technically be used, the typical interaction with a golf ball for activities like placing it on a tee or picking it up emphasizes precision and control rather than maximum force, making a Precision grasp more suitable.

Therefore, according to Feix's taxonomy (The GRASP taxonomy of human grasp types. IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems), the best grasp for this object (a golf ball) is the **Spherical Precision Grasp**."

Considering the typical action of picking up a golf ball, a **Palmar Pinch** is a strong candidate for the ""best"" grasp type according to Feix's taxonomy for this object and context."
data/golf/golf3.jpg,"['tripod', 'inferior pincer', 'quadpod']",precision sphere,"Based on Feix's GRASP taxonomy (The GRASP taxonomy of human grasp types), the ""best"" grasp for a small, light, spherical object like a golf ball typically falls into the **Precision** category.

Specifically, for a small sphere, common and suitable grasps from the taxonomy are:

1.  **Precision Sphere Grasp:** This involves holding the sphere using the tips of the fingers and the opposing thumb, allowing for fine manipulation.
2.  **Three-finger Pinch (Tripod):** This is a very common precision grasp for small objects, using the thumb, index finger, and middle finger. It allows for good control and is often used for picking up or placing small items.

While the specific ""best"" grasp might depend on the immediate *Purpose* (P in GRASP) – e.g., picking it up vs. placing it precisely on a tee vs. putting it in your pocket – the inherent characteristics of the golf ball (small, light, spherical) mean that a **Precision** grasp is almost always used rather than a Power grasp.

Therefore, referring directly to the taxonomy:

*   **G:** Precision Grasp
*   **R:** Opposed (Thumb opposes fingers)
*   **A:** Depends on context (e.g., Pronated, Supinated)
*   **S:** Spherical
*   **P:** Depends on context (e.g., Holding, Manipulating, Transporting)

Considering the grasp type itself, the most fitting descriptions from Feix's list for this object are the **Precision Sphere Grasp** or the **Three-finger Pinch (Tripod)**, both falling under the Precision category for a Spherical object with an Opposed thumb.

In many practical scenarios with a golf ball, the **Three-finger Pinch (Tripod)** is the most frequently employed grasp for picking it up or positioning it. However, the **Precision Sphere Grasp** is also a direct match based on the object's shape being spherical and the need for precision. Both are valid and common."

In a Lateral Pinch, the object (the credit card) is held between the pad of the thumb and the side of the index finger, allowing for precise control and manipulation of the card along its edge, which is common when inserting it into a slot or presenting it.

In Feix's taxonomy, the Lateral Grasp is often classified as a type of **Precision Grasp** (sometimes P5 or P6) or an **Intermediate Grasp** (sometimes I5), depending on the specific sub-categorization used. It's preferred over Power Grasps because the object is light and manipulation requires dexterity rather than force. A flat pinch (thumb and fingertip on opposite sides of the flat surface) is also a possible Precision Grasp, but the Lateral Grasp is very common for actions like swiping.

1.  **Lateral Grasp (Side Pinch):** This involves opposing the thumb pad to the radial side of the index finger (or sometimes the middle finger).

Here are the most likely candidates:

1.  **Lateral Precision:** This is a very common grasp where the object is held on its edge between the adducted thumb and the lateral side of the index finger. This is *exactly* how you often hold a credit card to swipe it through a reader or insert it into a slot.

2.  **Two-finger Pulp/Tip:** Holding the card flat between the pulp (pad) or tip of the thumb and the pulp/tip of the index finger. This is common for picking up the card, showing it, or holding it loosely.

3.  **Tripod Pulp/Tip:** Holding the card flat between the pulp/tip of the thumb, index finger, and middle finger. Also common for general holding or picking up.

While Two-finger and Tripod precision grasps are used for general handling, the **Lateral Precision** grasp is arguably the **best fit** or most specifically relevant grasp in Feix's taxonomy when considering the primary *manipulation* associated with a credit card (using its edge).

A **two-finger pad pinch** (thumb and index finger pads) or a **three-finger pad pinch** (thumb, index, and middle finger pads) is commonly used to grasp a flat, thin object like a credit card.

Another possibility, especially if gripping the edge, is a **Lateral Pinch** (Side Pinch), where the object is held between the pad of the thumb and the side of the index finger.

Two very likely candidates, both falling under categories often used for thin, flat objects, are:

1.  **Pad Opposition (or Pad Pinch):** This involves opposing the pad of the thumb against the pads of one or more fingers (typically the index and middle fingers, or all four). This grasp is commonly used to hold the card flat, perhaps when presenting it or just holding it loosely. It allows for stable holding of the flat surface.

2.  **Lateral Opposition (or Lateral Pinch / Lateral Grasp):** This involves opposing the pad of the thumb against the side of the index finger, or sometimes against the side of the middle finger or between two adjacent fingers. This grasp is typically used when holding the card edgewise, such as when inserting it into a reader or swiping it.

Given the image shows the card lying flat, a **Pad Opposition** (Pad Pinch) is a very natural and common way to pick up or hold the card in that orientation. However, the **Lateral Opposition** is also a primary functional grasp for its most common uses (transactions).

Therefore, the most appropriate grasps from Feix's taxonomy for a credit card are **Pad Opposition** (for holding flat) and **Lateral Opposition** (for holding edgewise for use).

Within the Precision Grasp category, there are two highly relevant types for a credit card, depending on the specific action:

1.  **Lateral Precision Grasp (also known as Key Pinch or Side Grasp):** This involves holding the object between the pad of the thumb and the lateral side (the side) of the index finger. This is a very common grasp for handling a card when inserting it into a slot (like an ATM or POS terminal) or swiping it, as it provides control for rigid movement along an edge. *Feix's paper often uses holding a key or a card for insertion as an example of this grasp.*

2.  **Palmar Precision Grasp (also known as Pulp Pinch):** This involves holding the object between the pad of the thumb and the pads (pulps) of one or more fingers (usually the index and/or middle finger). This is a common grasp for holding the card flat, examining it, or presenting it.

While both are valid Precision Grasps for a card, the **Lateral Precision Grasp** is perhaps the most characteristic and functionally relevant grasp specifically cited in descriptions related to manipulating a card for its primary use (insertion/swiping).

2.  **Typical Use:** Handling involves holding it by the edge, often between the thumb and the side of the index finger, to control its movement for insertion or swiping. This requires control and stability rather than enclosure for force transmission.
3.  **Taxonomy Fit:** The Lateral Grasp (also known as a Lateral Pinch or Clamp) is specifically defined as holding an object between the thumb and the side of the index finger (or between adjacent fingers). It is often categorized as a type of precision grasp or a distinct handling grasp suitable for flat objects. It allows for controlled manipulation and application of force in a specific direction (pushing or pulling the card).

2.  **Grasp Categories:**
    *   **Power Grasp:** Used for large, heavy objects requiring force and significant palmar contact. Not applicable to a credit card.
    *   **Precision Grasp:** Used for manipulating small objects where control and dexterity are paramount, often involving only finger-thumb opposition with minimal palmar contact. This fits holding a credit card for tasks like inserting it into a reader, swiping, or presenting it.
    *   **Special Grasp:** Reserved for highly specific objects or actions (like using scissors or a syringe). While a credit card is a specific object, the way it's held typically falls into a general precision pattern rather than a truly unique special grasp.
3.  **Sub-categories within Precision:** Within the Precision Grasp category, several sub-types could be used, but the most common for holding a flat card by its edges is often described by **Side Opposition (2.2)**, where the thumb opposes the side of one or more fingers supporting the other edge of the card. Other precision grasps like **Pad Opposition (2.1)** (holding it flat between thumb and finger pads) are also possible depending on the exact task (e.g., showing the card vs. inserting it).

Common ways to interact with a credit card include holding it to view details, presenting it for payment, swiping it, or inserting it into a reader.

Considering how a person typically holds a credit card to view the information on it or present it, they usually hold it flat, supported by the pads of the thumb on one side and the pads of one or more fingers (usually index and middle) on the other side. This allows for stable viewing and manipulation of the card's surface.

Looking at Feix's taxonomy categories:
-   **Power Grasps**: Generally involve the palm and fingers wrapping around an object for force application or stable carrying. The Plate/Pad grasp is for flat objects but usually involves holding them against the palm, which is less typical for fine manipulation like reading the card details.
-   **Precision Grasps**: Involve the fingertips or pads of the fingers and thumb for manipulation and fine control. This category includes the Pinch grasp and Lateral Pinch.

The action of holding the credit card flat with the pads of the thumb and fingers on opposing surfaces of the card is best described as a **Pinch grasp**. Specifically, it's often a multi-finger pad-to-pad pinch, where the pads of the thumb oppose the pads of two or more fingers (index, middle, etc.) to hold the flat object. This allows for stable support while leaving the surface visible.

The **Lateral Pinch** is another common way to hold a credit card, specifically for tasks like swiping or handing it over, where the card is held between the thumb and the side of the index finger. However, holding the card flat to view it, as often done when looking at the details shown in the image, better fits the description of a Pinch grasp using the finger pads.

However, considering how coins are typically handled (picked up, counted, inserted, flipped, etc.), the dominant grasps fall under the category of **Precision Grasps**.

Here's a breakdown according to Feix's taxonomy:

1.  **Grasping Type:** For a small, light, and often manipulated object like a coin, **Precision Grasps** are typically used over Power Grasps. Precision grasps allow for fine control and manipulation using the fingertips. Power grasps are more suited for larger, heavier objects where stability and force are needed.

2.  **Specific Precision Grasp Types applicable to a Coin:**
    *   **Pinch Grasp (2-finger or 3-finger):** This is a very common way to pick up a coin from a flat surface or hold it for inspection. It involves the pads of the thumb and one or two fingers (index and potentially middle) opposing each other on the object's surface or edge. Feix's taxonomy includes 2-finger, 3-finger, 4-finger, and 5-finger pinches. The 2-finger (thumb-index) or 3-finger (thumb-index-middle, often called a tripod) are most relevant for a single coin.
    *   **Lateral Grasp (also called Lateral Pinch):** This grasp involves the thumb pad pressing the object against the side of the index finger (or occasionally the side of the middle finger). This is often used for holding a coin securely before inserting it into a slot, or for manipulating it between fingers.

**Conclusion:**

For a coin like the one shown, the ""best"" grasp according to Feix's taxonomy is likely one of the **Precision Grasps**. The most common and suitable specific types are the **Pinch Grasp (2-finger or 3-finger)** for picking up and general manipulation, and the **Lateral Grasp** for secure holding and insertion.

Without a specific task defined, it's difficult to name *one* absolute ""best"". However, *Precision Grasp* is the overarching category, and *Pinch* (2 or 3 finger) or *Lateral* are the most likely specific grasps. The 2-finger Pinch or 3-finger Pinch are arguably the most fundamental ways to simply grasp such an object from a surface."

The most suitable grasps for a coin, depending on the specific action, fall under the **Precision Grasp** category or specific grasps listed by Feix that function similarly for flat objects.

Considering common ways to hold and manipulate a coin, such as picking it up, examining it, or inserting it:

1.  **Lateral Pinch:** Holding the coin between the pad of the thumb and the lateral (side) aspect of the index finger. This is a very common and stable grasp for a coin, allowing control and manipulation, often used when holding the coin by its edge.
2.  **Tip Pinch:** Holding the coin between the tip of the thumb and the tip(s) of one or more fingers (e.g., index finger, or index and middle fingers). This is often used for picking up a coin or for finer manipulation. Feix lists ""Thumb-2 Finger Tip"" and ""Thumb-3 Finger Tip"" grasps.

While both Lateral Pinch and Tip Pinch are excellent fits, the **Lateral Pinch** is often a stable hold when examining or manipulating a coin by its edges, which is a frequent interaction. The Tip Pinch is also very common, particularly for initial acquisition.

Given the lack of context on the specific task, and considering common handling for manipulation and examination, **Lateral Pinch** is arguably one of the best fits from Feix's explicit grasp types for a coin. However, **Tip Pinch** is also highly applicable.

Therefore, suitable grasps from Feix's taxonomy include:

*   **Lateral Pinch**
*   **Tip Pinch** (specifically Thumb-2 Finger Tip or Thumb-3 Finger Tip)

Without a specific task, choosing one ""best"" is difficult, but both are strong candidates as they represent common, stable, and functional ways to interact with a flat, small object like a coin according to the taxonomy. If forced to pick one representative stable hold, **Lateral Pinch** is a primary option."

2.  **Grasp Function:** Interacting with a single coin usually involves control and dexterity rather than brute force or power.
3.  **Feix's Categories:** Precision Grasps in Feix's taxonomy are characterized by the use of the fingertips (or finger pads) and thumb, allowing for fine control and manipulation. Power grasps involve the palm and fingers wrapping around the object for force, which is not suitable for a single coin.

Within the Precision Grasp category, the most appropriate specific types for a coin are:

*   **Two-Finger Pinch (Pulp Pinch):** Using the pads (pulps) of the thumb and typically the index finger to hold the coin. This is very common for picking up, examining, or holding for insertion.

4.  **Feix Taxonomy Application:**
    *   **Power Grasps** (Cylindrical, Spherical, Hook, etc.) are designed for applying force or holding large objects; they are completely unsuitable for this thin, standing object.
    *   **Precision Grasps** use opposition between the fingers and thumb for fine manipulation or picking up small objects. This fits the task.
    *   Within Precision Grasp:
        *   **Tip Grasp:** Using only the very tips might be too unstable for a thin object on edge.
        *   **Lateral Grasp:** Holding between the side of the index finger and thumb pad is possible, but less secure for gripping the flat faces of the coin when lifting from the edge.
        *   **Pad Grasp:** Using the pads of the index finger and thumb (and possibly the middle finger) allows you to grip the relatively large, flat sides of the coin securely, providing stability as you lift it from its precarious position.

Considering common ways to hold a coin for viewing and the types in Feix's 17 grasp taxonomy, the most suitable grasp types are:

1.  **Palmar Pinch (#5):** This involves the thumb pad opposing the pads of one or more fingers (typically the index finger for a coin). This allows for precise manipulation and rotation of the coin for inspection. This is a very common way to hold a coin to examine its details.
2.  **Lateral Pinch (#6):** This involves the thumb pad opposing the lateral side of the index finger. This is also a common way to pick up and hold a flat object like a coin, providing good control.

While both are suitable, the **Palmar Pinch** (specifically the two-finger Pad Opposition or Pad-to-Pad variant) is often considered the most versatile and precise grip for detailed examination and manipulation of small, flat objects like coins, allowing easy rotation and inspection of both sides.

Without a specific task, both Palmar Pinch (e.g., 2-finger) and Lateral Grasp are very suitable. However, if the intent is to examine the details on the coin's face, a **2-Finger Palmar Pinch** is arguably the ""best"" in the sense of providing stable support while allowing clear viewing of both sides (by rotating).

Therefore, a strong candidate for the best grasp is the **Palmar Pinch (2-Finger)**."

More specifically, considering the flat, relatively thin and rigid nature of the object, common ways to hold it for examination or display would involve using the fingertips or pads. Suitable precision grasps include:

1.  **Lateral Pinch (or Key Pinch):** This grasp involves the thumb pad pressing against the lateral side of the index finger (or sometimes multiple fingers). It's commonly used for holding thin, flat objects like keys, cards, or the edge of a coin holder. This grasp is excellent for controlling the object's position and orientation for viewing.
2.  **Pad Pinch (2-finger, 3-finger, or more):** This involves the thumb pad pressing against the pad(s) of one or more fingers, holding the flat surface of the object. This provides a stable grip on the face of the holder.

Between these, the **Lateral Pinch** is often very effective for holding the edge of such an object, allowing the viewer to see the surface (the coin) clearly without obscuring it with the fingers, and offering good control for manipulating the holder. However, a **Pad Pinch** holding the entire flat surface is also a very common and stable way to hold such an object for viewing.

Without seeing the hand holding the object, both are strong candidates within the Precision Grasp category. The Lateral Pinch might be considered particularly characteristic for gripping the edge of a thin, flat object for examination.

Therefore, the best grasp is likely a **Precision Grasp**, specifically either a **Lateral Pinch** or a **Pad Pinch**. The Lateral Pinch might be slightly more specific to the action of holding the edge of a thin holder for viewing."
data/coin/coin4.jpeg,"['p', 'a', 'l', 'm', 'a', 'r', ' ', 'p', 'i', 'n', 'c', 'h']",lateral,"Based on Feix's GRASP taxonomy (The GRASP taxonomy of human grasp types. IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems), the most likely and suitable grasps for the coin shown in the image (standing on its edge) would fall under the categories designed for manipulating small, thin objects, particularly when needing precision or careful handling to pick them up from a surface.

Here are the most relevant types from Feix's taxonomy:

1.  **Lateral Grasp (Power Grasp type):** This involves pressing the object against the side of the index finger using the thumb pad. It is commonly used for thin objects like keys, cards, or coins held along their edge. This grasp provides good stability for picking up the coin from its precarious position.
    *   *Feix's Classification:* Power Grasp.

2.  **Tip-to-Tip Grasp (2-finger Precision Grasp type):** This involves grasping the object between the tips of the thumb and one finger (usually the index finger). It's used for manipulating very small objects with high precision. Picking up the coin by pinching its edge with the tips of the thumb and index finger fits this description well.
    *   *Feix's Classification:* Precision Grasp (specifically a 2-finger Tip grasp).

3.  **Prismatic Grasp (2- or 3-finger Precision Grasp type):** While a coin lying flat is often picked up with a 3-finger Prismatic grasp (thumb, index, middle finger pads on the surface), a 2-finger Prismatic grasp (thumb pad and one finger pad) could also be used to grasp the *sides* of the coin once it's partially upright or picked up. However, for the initial act of grasping it while standing precariously on edge, the Tip-to-Tip or Lateral grasp on the *edge* is more probable.

Considering the unstable pose (on edge), the most direct and common ways to interact with it would be to stabilize it or pick it up carefully by grasping its edge. Therefore, the **Lateral Grasp** and the **2-finger Tip-to-Tip Precision Grasp** are the best fits from Feix's taxonomy for the object in this specific pose, depending on whether stability (Lateral) or fine control (Tip-to-Tip) is prioritized. The Lateral grasp is arguably slightly more common for simply *picking up* a coin from a surface."
data/coin/coin2.jpeg,"['p', 'a', 'l', 'm', 'a', 'r', ' ', 'p', 'i', 'n', 'c', 'h']",lateral,"Based on the Feix grasp taxonomy, the object is a small, flat disc (a US quarter). Objects of this nature are typically handled using **Precision Grasps**, as fine manipulation and control are required, rather than powerful squeezing.

Within the Precision Grasp category, the most fitting type for a small, flat disc like a coin is the **Disc Grasp (Precision)**.

Here's why:

1.  **Precision Grasp:** The object is small and light, requiring the use of fingertips and thumb for control, not the full palm for power.
2.  **Disc Grasp (Precision):** This specific subtype of precision grasp is defined for holding flat, circular objects. It involves opposing the pad of the thumb against the pads of one or more fingers (often the index and/or middle finger) to hold the object flat and stable.

While a simple **Pad Pinch** (Thumb-2 finger pad pinch or Thumb-3 finger pad pinch) is also applicable and very similar, the Feix taxonomy often includes more specific categories when the object shape dictates a particular grip pattern. The **Disc Grasp** is precisely that more specific category for flat, circular objects.

Other precision grips like the Lateral Pinch might be used for picking it up from a surface or inserting it into a slot, but the **Disc Grasp** is generally considered the most stable and controlled way to hold a coin for viewing or general manipulation.

Therefore, the best grasp for a quarter based on the Feix taxonomy is the **Disc Grasp (Precision)**."
data/coin/coin43.jpeg,"['p', 'a', 'l', 'm', 'a', 'r', ' ', 'p', 'i', 'n', 'c', 'h']",tripod,"Based on Feix's grasp taxonomy, and considering the object is a small, flat coin, the most appropriate grasp type for typical interaction (such as picking up, examining, or inserting) is a **Precision Grasp**.

Specifically, within the Precision Grasp category, a coin is commonly handled using either:

1.  **Pulp-to-Pulp Grasp:** The thumb pulp opposes the pulp of one finger (typically the index finger). This is efficient for picking up or transferring the coin.
2.  **Tripod Grasp:** The thumb pulp opposes the pulps of the index and middle fingers. This provides a more stable hold for examining or manipulating the coin.

Given the request for ""the best"" grasp, and recognizing that the image focuses on the coin's details suggesting it might be held for examination, the **Tripod Grasp** is a strong candidate as it offers greater stability for such tasks compared to the two-finger Pulp-to-Pulp grasp. It is a 2-Virtual Finger precision grasp according to Feix's classification.

Therefore, the best grasp for this object according to Feix's taxonomy is likely a **Tripod Grasp**."

Here's why:

1.  **Object Characteristics:** The coin is a small, flat, relatively thin disc. It doesn't require significant force to hold or manipulate.
2.  **Typical Interaction:** Handling a coin usually involves picking it up, transferring it, or examining its details, which requires control and stability rather than brute force.
3.  **Precision Grasp Definition:** Precision grasps involve using the fingertips or pads of the fingers and thumb to manipulate or hold small objects where control is paramount.
4.  **Two-finger Pinch:** This common precision grasp uses the pad of the thumb against the pad of the index finger (or sometimes the middle finger) to hold a small object. This provides excellent control and is ideal for the size and shape of a coin.

Therefore, the **Two-finger pinch (Pad-to-pad)**, categorized under **Precision Grasps**, is the most appropriate grasp according to Feix's taxonomy for this object."
data/coin/coin51.jpg,"['p', 'a', 'l', 'm', 'a', 'r', ' ', 'p', 'i', 'n', 'c', 'h']",,"Based on Feix's grasp taxonomy, the object is a **coin**, which is small, flat, and rigid. The typical task when handling a coin like this (implied by the detailed image suitable for examination) is holding it securely for inspection, display, or transfer. This requires control rather than significant force.

Therefore, the best grasp according to Feix's taxonomy would fall under the **Precision Grasp** category.

Specifically, a common and effective grasp for a coin is a **Pinch grasp**, where the object is held between the opposing thumb and fingertips. A **Three-finger Pinch** (using the thumb, index finger, and middle finger) is particularly stable for holding a coin flat for examination. A **Two-finger Pinch** (thumb and index finger) is also possible, but the three-finger pinch offers more control and stability.

Considering the likelihood of examining the coin shown in detail, the **Three-finger Pinch** is likely the ""best"" or most appropriate grasp for achieving control and stability for this task.

So, the best grasp is a **Precision Grasp**, specifically a **Three-finger Pinch**."
