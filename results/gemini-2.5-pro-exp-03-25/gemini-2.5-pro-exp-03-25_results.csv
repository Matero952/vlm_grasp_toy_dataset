According to Feix's grasp taxonomy, several grasps could be used, but the ""best"" depends on the intended action. However, for a general secure hold of a spherical object like a tennis ball, the most appropriate grasp would be:

1.  **Spherical Power Grasp (Feix G1.1)**:
    *   **Description**: The object is spherical. The fingers and thumb are adducted and flexed around the object to maximize contact area. The palm is typically involved to provide stability and force.
    *   **Why it's best for a general hold**: This grasp allows for a firm and secure hold on the ball, suitable for holding it, preparing to throw, or resisting external forces. The hand conforms to the shape of the ball.

While precision grasps like the **Sphere, 3-finger (Tripod variant for spheres, Feix G2.4)** or **Sphere, 4-finger (Feix G2.5)** could be used for picking up the ball or manipulating it with fingertips (e.g., applying spin before a serve), the **Spherical Power Grasp** is generally considered the primary and most stable way to ""grasp"" a tennis ball for a secure hold.

Therefore, the best general grasp for this object based on Feix's taxonomy is the **Spherical Power Grasp**."
data/tennis/tennis16.jpeg,"['power sphere', 'precision sphere', 'sphere 3 finger', 'sphere 4 finger']",,"Okay, let's analyze the object (a tennis ball) based on Feix's grasp taxonomy.

1.  **Object Characteristics:**
    *   Shape: Sphere
    *   Size: Fits comfortably within the palm and fingers of an adult hand.
    *   Task Implied: Typically picked up, held securely, possibly thrown or prepared for serving/hitting.

2.  **Feix's Taxonomy Categories:** The taxonomy broadly divides grasps into Power and Precision, and then further categorizes them based on object shape, finger configuration, and opposition type. Key relevant categories include those for spherical objects.

3.  **Analysis:**
    *   **Power vs. Precision:** While you *could* pick up a tennis ball with a precision grasp (e.g., using fingertips), the most common and stable way to hold it securely, especially for tasks like throwing, involves conforming the hand around the ball. This points towards a power grasp.
    *   **Shape:** The object is clearly spherical.
    *   **Matching Grasp Type:** Within Feix's taxonomy, the grasp type specifically designed for holding spherical objects securely using the palm and fingers is the **Spherical Power Grasp**. In this grasp, the fingers flex around the object, conforming to its shape, and are typically opposed by the thumb. The palm is usually involved to provide stability.

**Conclusion:**

Based on Feix's grasp taxonomy, the best and most typical grasp for securely holding a tennis ball is the **Spherical Power Grasp**."
data/tennis/tennis17.jpeg,"['power sphere', 'precision sphere', 'sphere 3 finger', 'sphere 4 finger']",power sphere,"Okay, let's analyze this based on Feix's Grasp Taxonomy.

The object is a **tennis ball**, which is clearly **spherical**.

Considering the typical ways one would interact with a tennis ball (picking it up, holding it, preparing to throw/serve), the most common and effective grasp would be a **Power Grasp**.

Within the Power Grasps, Feix's taxonomy has a specific category for this:

1.  **Power Sphere (or Spherical Power Grasp):**
    *   **Description:** The object is held against the palm, and the fingers (and thumb) flex to conform to the spherical shape of the object. All or most of the fingers and the palm are in contact with the object.
    *   **Why it's best:** This grasp provides maximum contact area and security for holding a spherical object like a tennis ball, especially when picking it up, holding it firmly, or preparing for an action like throwing. The opposition is typically between the thumb and the fingers, with the palm providing a stable base.

While you *could* hold a tennis ball with a precision grasp (e.g., a ""Precision Sphere"" using only fingertips, or a ""Tripod"" if you were very delicately placing it), these would not be considered the ""best"" or most typical grasp for general handling, security, or power application (like throwing).

Therefore, based on Feix's grasp taxonomy, the best grasp for the tennis ball is the **Spherical Power Grasp**."
data/tennis/tennis19.jpeg,"['power sphere', 'precision sphere', 'sphere 3 finger', 'sphere 4 finger']",power sphere,"Based on Feix's grasp taxonomy, the best grasp for a tennis ball would be a **Power Sphere** (also referred to as Spherical Power Grasp).

Here's why:
*   **Shape:** The object is spherical.
*   **Grasp characteristics:** To securely hold a tennis ball, one would typically use all fingers and the thumb flexed around the object, maximizing contact area. The palm is usually involved to provide stability and power, which is characteristic of a power grasp.

In Feix's taxonomy, the ""Power Sphere"" grasp is described as: ""All fingers and the thumb are flexed around the object to maximize contact area and stability. The palm is typically involved."" This perfectly matches how a tennis ball is commonly held."
data/tennis/tennis15.jpg,"['power sphere', 'precision sphere', 'sphere 3 finger', 'sphere 4 finger']",tripod,"Okay, let's analyze this based on Feix's Grasp Taxonomy.

The object is a tennis ball, which is:
*   **Shape:** Spherical
*   **Size:** Fits comfortably within a single hand.

Considering Feix's taxonomy:

1.  **Power Grasps:** These are used when force and stability are primary. The object is typically held against the palm, with fingers and thumb exerting force.
    *   **Sphere:** This grasp is defined for spherical objects. The fingers and thumb curve around the object, and the palm is often involved in stabilizing it. This seems like a very strong candidate.

2.  **Precision Grasps:** These are used for dexterity and fine manipulation, typically involving the fingertips.
    *   While you *could* pick up a tennis ball with a tripod pinch (Thumb-2 Finger) or a quadpod pinch (Thumb-3 Finger), it wouldn't be the most secure or typical ""best"" grasp for general holding or preparing for an action like throwing.

3.  **Intermediate Grasps:** These are a mix, but none seem perfectly suited.

Given the shape and the typical way one would hold a tennis ball securely, the most appropriate grasp is:

**Sphere (Power Grasp)**

This is because a tennis ball is a spherical object, and the most natural and secure way to hold it involves wrapping the fingers and thumb around its surface, often with the palm providing support, which is characteristic of a power sphere grasp."

Here's why:

1.  **Shape:** The object is a sphere.
2.  **Size:** A tennis ball fits comfortably within the palm and fingers of an average adult hand.
3.  **Grasp Type:** The Spherical Power Grasp involves flexing the fingers and thumb around the spherical object, often making contact with the palm. This provides a stable and secure hold, suitable for picking up, holding, or throwing the ball.

While precision grasps (like a Tripod grasp) could be used to pick it up delicately, the Spherical Power Grasp is the most robust and common grasp for an object of this shape and size according to the taxonomy."
data/tennis/tennis12.jpeg,"['power sphere', 'precision sphere', 'sphere 3 finger', 'sphere 4 finger']",,"Based on Feix's grasp taxonomy, the ""best"" or most encompassing and secure grasp for a tennis ball would be a **Spherical Power Grasp**.

Here's why:

1.  **Power Grasp Category:** The primary goal when picking up or holding a tennis ball is usually to secure it firmly, often for throwing or preparing to hit. Power grasps are characterized by the object being held against the palm, with fingers and thumb exerting force.
2.  **Spherical Sub-type:**
    *   The tennis ball is clearly a spherical object.
    *   In a Spherical Power Grasp, the fingers and thumb flex to conform to the shape of the sphere.
    *   The palm is typically involved, providing a stable base and increasing the contact area for a secure hold.
    *   This grasp allows for significant force to be applied if needed (e.g., when gripping firmly before a throw).

While you *could* pick up a tennis ball with a precision grasp (like a **Pulp-5 / Five-finger precision grasp**, using all fingertips), it would be less secure and not typically what one would use unless the intention was very delicate manipulation or if the ball was, for example, covered in something one didn't want to touch with the palm.

For general purpose holding, control, and power application (like throwing), the **Spherical Power Grasp** is the most appropriate classification from Feix's taxonomy for a tennis ball."
data/tennis/tennis21.jpg,"['power sphere', 'precision sphere', 'sphere 3 finger', 'sphere 4 finger']",power sphere,"The object in the image is a tennis ball, which is a relatively small, spherical object. To determine the best grasp based on Feix's grasp taxonomy from ""The GRASP taxonomy of human grasp types"" (Feix et al., 2015/2016, IEEE Transactions on Human-Machine Systems), we need to consider the categories and specific grasps defined in that paper.

Feix's taxonomy divides grasps into three main categories:
1.  **Power Grasps**: Object held against the palm, large contact areas, for stability and force.
2.  **Precision Grasps**: Object held by fingertips, away from the palm, for dexterity and manipulation.
3.  **Intermediate Grasps**: Share characteristics of both power and precision grasps.

Let's consider grasps suitable for a tennis ball from this taxonomy:

*   **From Power Grasps**:
    *   **Small Diameter Grasp**: ""The object is grasped with the fingers flexed around it, it is stabilized against the palm with the thumb exerting counter pressure on the object."" This could apply, as a tennis ball is a small 3D object that can be encompassed.

*   **From Precision Grasps**:
    *   **Sphere 4-finger Grasp**: ""The thumb and three fingers (index, middle, and ring) hold a spherical object at the fingertips. The palm does not make contact with the object.""
    *   **Sphere 3-finger Grasp**: ""The thumb and two fingers (index and middle) hold a spherical object at the fingertips. The palm does not make contact with the object.""
    These are suitable for manipulating a sphere but offer less security than a power-type grasp.

*   **From Intermediate Grasps**:
    *   **Power Sphere Grasp**: ""The object (typically spherical) is held with the fingers and thumb flexed around it. The palm can be involved to a variable degree."" The figure associated with this grasp (Fig. 5a in the paper) clearly shows a hand holding a ball in this manner.

Considering the characteristics of a tennis ball and the goal of a ""best"" (implying a common, secure, and functional) grasp:

The **Power Sphere Grasp** from the Intermediate Grasps category appears to be the most fitting.
*   It is specifically designed for spherical objects.
*   It describes a secure hold involving fingers and thumb wrapping around the ball.
*   The ""intermediate"" classification acknowledges that while it's a strong grip (like a power grasp), it also allows for some degree of manipulation (like a precision grasp), which is typical for handling a ball. The variable palm involvement also makes it versatile.
*   The example illustration for ""Power Sphere"" in Feix's paper is a hand grasping a ball.

Compared to other options:
*   ""Small Diameter Grasp"" (Power) is plausible but less specific to spheres; its example is often a small cylinder.
*   ""Sphere X-finger Grasps"" (Precision) are fingertip-only and thus less secure for general holding compared to a grasp involving the palm, though they are used for fine control.

Therefore, for general holding of a tennis ball, the **Power Sphere Grasp** is the most appropriate choice from Feix's 2015/2016 taxonomy.

The best grasp for the tennis ball, based on Feix's grasp taxonomy, is the **Power Sphere Grasp**."

1.  **Object Shape:** The object is clearly a sphere.
2.  **Grasp Definition:** The Sphere grasp (often categorized under Power grasps) is characterized by the fingers and palm conforming to the spherical shape of an object to secure it. The fingers spread out and flex to make contact around the ball's surface, and the palm often provides a base or additional contact points depending on the ball's size relative to the hand.

While a smaller sphere might also be picked up with a precision grasp like a ""Five Finger Prismatic Pinch"" if a very delicate lift is needed, the most common and stable way to hold, throw, or catch a tennis ball involves encompassing it, which aligns with the Sphere grasp."

1.  **Object Analysis:** The object is a tennis ball. It's spherical, relatively small (fits within one hand), lightweight, and has a textured surface.

2.  **Feix's Taxonomy Considerations:** The taxonomy categorizes grasps based on factors like power vs. precision, the number of fingers used, and the contact surfaces (palm, finger pads, etc.).

3.  **Evaluating Grasp Types:**
    *   **Power Grasps:** These involve significant palm contact and are used for stability and applying force. Given the size and shape, a power grasp is very suitable for holding the ball securely.
    *   **Precision Grasps:** These involve the fingertips and are used for dexterity and fine manipulation. While you *could* pick up a tennis ball with a precision grasp (like a Tripod or Quadpod), it's generally not the most stable or common way to simply hold it.

4.  **Best Fit:** Considering the spherical shape and the typical way one would securely hold a tennis ball, the most appropriate grasp from Feix's taxonomy is the **Power Sphere**.

The most suitable grasps would be:

1.  **Precision Sphere Grasp**:

2.  **Feix's Taxonomy Categories (relevant ones):**
    *   **Power Grasps:** Emphasize security and force.
        *   *Spherical:* All fingers and palm are used to hold a spherical object.
        *   *Cylindrical:* Fingers and palm wrap around a cylindrical object.
        *   *Disk:* Fingers spread and flexed around a disk.
    *   **Precision Grasps:** Emphasize dexterity and fine motor control, typically with fingertips.
        *   *Tripod (Palmar Pinch):* Thumb, index, and middle finger.
        *   *Pinch (Tip Pinch):* Thumb and index fingertip.
    *   **Intermediate Grasps:** A blend, more finger involvement than pure precision, less palm than pure power.
        *   *Medium Wrap:* Fingers flexed around the object, thumb opposes, providing counterforce. Palm contact is minimal or moderate, not as encompassing as a full power grasp.
        *   *Light Tool Grasp:* For holding light tools.

3.  **Analysis for a Tennis Ball:**
    *   You wouldn't typically use a pure *Precision Grasp* like a Pinch or Tripod to just pick up or hold a tennis ball securely for general purposes, though you *could* for a very light touch.
    *   A full *Spherical Power Grasp* would involve maximum palm contact and all fingers, often for exerting significant force (like preparing for a very hard throw). While possible, it's often more than necessary for simply holding.
    *   The **Medium Wrap** seems most appropriate. The fingers would wrap around the ball, and the thumb would oppose the fingers to secure it. There would be some palm contact, but it wouldn't be the full, forceful engulfment of a Spherical Power grasp. It's a common, secure way to hold a ball of this size.

**Conclusion:**

Based on Feix's taxonomy, the most fitting grasp for generally holding a tennis ball is the **Medium Wrap**.

It allows for a secure hold with the fingers wrapping around the sphere and the thumb providing opposition, without necessarily engaging the entire palm as strongly as a full ""Spherical Power Grasp"" would imply. If the intention was to throw with maximum force, then ""Spherical Power Grasp"" would be more accurate. But for a general hold or pickup, ""Medium Wrap"" is a better fit."

    *   **Use for a tennis ball:** This is used when a secure, stable hold is required, for instance, when just holding the ball, carrying it, or preparing for a powerful action where fine manipulation isn't the immediate next step. This offers maximum contact and stability.

2.  **Precision Sphere Grasp (often just called ""Spherical"" under precision grasps):**
    *   **Description:** The fingers and thumb are adducted/abducted and flexed around the object, allowing control over its orientation. The palm may or may not be fully involved, with more emphasis on the fingertips.
    *   **Use for a tennis ball:** This is used when more control and manipulation are needed, such as when preparing to serve (to orient the seams or apply spin), or when picking up the ball with the intention of precise placement or a controlled throw.

Given the general nature of the question ""best grasp for this object,"" and if the primary goal is to securely hold it, the **Power Sphere** grasp is a very suitable description. If the context implies preparing for a specific tennis action (like a serve), the **Precision Sphere** would also be highly relevant.

Since the question asks for the ""best"" grasp without further context on the task, the **Power Sphere** is a strong candidate as it describes a full, secure hold on the ball. However, it's important to note that for actual use in tennis, a **Precision Sphere** (or a grasp that blends power and precision characteristics) is very common.

If forced to choose one that best describes a fundamental way to hold a sphere of this size securely, it would be the **Power Sphere** grasp."

    *   Task Implied: Picking up, holding, manipulating (e.g., for serving, throwing).

2.  **Feix's Taxonomy Categories:** The taxonomy broadly divides grasps into Power, Precision, and Intermediate types, further subdivided based on thumb position, number of fingers, and contact points.

3.  **Evaluating Grasp Options:**
    *   **Power Grasps:** These involve significant palm contact and are used for stability and applying force *with* the object. The *Spherical Power Grasp* (Type 1 in the full taxonomy) involves wrapping the fingers and thumb around the sphere with palm contact. While possible, it's often overkill for simply picking up or manipulating a tennis ball unless high force is needed.
    *   **Precision Grasps:** These prioritize dexterity and manipulation, typically using fingertips/pads with less or no palm contact. The *Precision Sphere Grasp* (Type 17 in the full taxonomy) involves holding the sphere with the pads of the fingers and thumb, spread around the object, allowing for fine control. This aligns well with how one would pick up a tennis ball from a surface or hold it for a controlled action like a serve toss.
    *   **Other Precision Grasps:** Tripod or Quadpod grasps might be used, but the ""Sphere"" specific grasps are more descriptive for this shape. Pinch grasps are unsuitable for this size.

A precision grasp involves using the fingertips.
3.  **Sphere (precision):** This grasp involves holding a spherical object with the tips of the fingers (and thumb), typically using 3-5 digits. The palm is usually not heavily involved, allowing for finer control and manipulation. This perfectly describes how one would typically pick up a tennis ball from a surface.

A ""Sphere (power)"" grasp would be more like palming a basketball or a larger ball where the fingers and palm wrap around it for maximum force and security, which is less common for a tennis ball unless perhaps catching a very fast-moving one with one hand.

data/tennis/tennis2.jpg,"['power sphere', 'precision sphere', 'sphere 3 finger', 'sphere 4 finger']",tripod,"Okay, let's break this down using Feix's Grasp Taxonomy.

1.  **Object Shape:** The tennis ball is fundamentally a **sphere**.

    *   **Power grasps** are used when force and stability are paramount, often involving the palm.
    *   **Precision grasps** are used for fine manipulation and dexterity, typically involving the fingertips and holding the object away from the palm.

    For holding a tennis ball securely, for example, before a serve or to throw it, a power grasp is more typical and stable. While you *can* pick it up with a precision grasp (e.g., with fingertips), the ""best"" or most functional grasp for its common uses would lean towards power.

3.  **Feix's Categories for Spheres:**
    *   Under **Power Grasps**, there is ""Sphere"" (e.g., holding a softball or a large orange). This involves the fingers flexing around the object, with the palm often making contact or being very close.
    *   Under **Precision Grasps**, there is also ""Sphere"" (e.g., holding a marble with fingertips – Tripod, Quadpod, etc.).

4.  **Determining the ""Best"" Grasp:**
    Given the size of a tennis ball and how it's typically handled (held securely, thrown, caught), the **Power Sphere** grasp is the most appropriate. This would involve wrapping the fingers around the ball, with the thumb providing opposition. The palm would likely be involved or very close to the ball to provide stability.

Therefore, based on Feix's grasp taxonomy, the best grasp for a tennis ball is:

2.  **Grasp Type:** A Spherical Power Grasp involves wrapping the fingers and thumb around a sphere-like object. The palm may or may not be involved depending on the size of the object relative to the hand, but the fingers conform to the curved surface.
3.  **Purpose:** This grasp provides a secure hold on the ball, suitable for holding, picking up, or preparing to throw it, which aligns with the typical interaction with a tennis ball. It maximizes contact area for stability.
4.  **Feix Classification:** The Spherical grasp is explicitly listed as one of the main Power grasps in Feix's taxonomy. While precision grasps (like Tripod or Quadpod) *could* be used, they wouldn't be as stable or typical for securely holding an object of this size and shape."
data/tennis/tennis5.jpg,"['power sphere', 'precision sphere', 'sphere 3 finger', 'sphere 4 finger']",tripod,"Okay, based on Feix's grasp taxonomy, the most suitable and common grasp for a tennis ball would be a **Spherical Power Grasp**.

Here's why:

1.  **Object Shape:** The tennis ball is spherical.
2.  **Grasp Definition:**
    *   **Power Grasp:** Involves the entire hand, with the fingers and thumb wrapping around the object to provide stability and allow for force to be exerted. The object is often held against the palm.
    *   **Spherical Power Grasp:** This is a subtype of the power grasp specifically for spherical or near-spherical objects. The fingers and thumb are flexed to conform to the object's round shape, and the palm is typically involved to maximize contact and security.

When you pick up or hold a tennis ball, you naturally wrap your fingers and thumb around it, often with the ball nestled into your palm. This provides a secure grip for holding, throwing, or even squeezing.

While you *could* pick up a tennis ball with a precision grasp (e.g., a Tripod or Quadpod grasp using just the fingertips and thumb), it would be less stable and not the ""best"" or most natural way to securely hold an object of this size and shape for most tasks. The Spherical Power Grasp offers maximum stability and control."
data/cd/cd2.jpg,"['power disk', 'precision disk']",tripod,"Okay, let's analyze the object and apply Feix's grasp taxonomy.

1.  **Object:** A standard CD or DVD. It's thin, flat, circular, with a hole in the center. Key handling constraints are avoiding fingerprints/scratches on the data surface.
2.  **Feix's Taxonomy:** Divides grasps primarily into Power and Precision, with further subdivisions based on finger usage and object shape interaction.
3.  **Analysis for CD/DVD:**
    *   **Power grasps** are unsuitable; they involve large contact areas and force, which aren't needed and would damage the disc surface.
    *   **Precision grasps** are appropriate for manipulating small or delicate objects. We need to find the best fit within this category.

4.  **Evaluating Precision Grasps:**
    *   **Tip Pinch:** Thumb tip to index fingertip. Possible on the very edge, but not very stable.
    *   **Tripod/Quadpod Pinch (Palmar Pinch):** Thumb opposing 2 or 3 fingertips. Commonly used to pick up objects. Could be used *on the edge* of the CD to avoid the surface. This is a viable and common way to handle a CD.
    *   **Lateral Pinch (Key Pinch):** Thumb pad to the side of the index finger. Less suitable for a thin, flat disc edge.
    *   **Precision Disk:** This grasp is specifically described for handling disk-like objects (like a jar lid or, indeed, a CD). It often involves fingers spread somewhat around the edge, possibly with the thumb opposing on the edge or stabilizing near the center. A very common and recommended way to hold a CD is to insert the index finger into the center hole and place the thumb on the outer edge. This specific technique utilizes the object's unique features (hole and edge) for stable, precise handling while avoiding the data surface. This method aligns well with the functional description and intent of a *Precision Disk* grasp, adapted to the specific object. Pinching the disc only at opposite edges (like a Tripod Pinch) also fits.

5.  **Conclusion:**
    The two most appropriate and safe grasps are:
    *   Pinching the opposite edges (e.g., Thumb opposite Index and Middle finger - a **Tripod Pinch**).
    *   Inserting the Index finger into the center hole and placing the Thumb on the outer edge.

    Both are *Precision Grasps*. The center-hole-and-edge method is often considered the most stable and safest. While it doesn't perfectly match a single diagrammatic example in the basic taxonomy, it functionally fits best under the **Precision Disk** category, as it's a precision grasp tailored to the unique geometry of this specific type of disk. Pinching the edge also fits well under **Tripod Pinch** (or similar multi-finger pinches).

    Given that the center-hole grasp is highly specific and effective for CDs/DVDs, and the ""Disk"" category exists, **Precision Disk** is arguably the best classification, encompassing methods optimized for disc handling. If strictly adhering to edge-only contact, **Tripod Pinch** would also be a correct answer. However, utilizing the center hole is a key aspect of handling these objects precisely.

Therefore, the best grasp based on typical, safe handling and Feix's categories is:

**Precision Disk** (specifically, the variation using the center hole and outer edge) or **Tripod Pinch** (if gripping only the edges)."
data/cd/cd17.jpg,"['power disk', 'precision disk']",tripod,"Okay, let's analyze the object (a DVD-RAM disc) and apply Feix's grasp taxonomy.

**Object Characteristics:**
*   Thin, flat, circular disc.
*   Has a central hole.
*   Relatively lightweight.
*   Requires careful handling to avoid scratches on the data surface and fingerprints.
*   Tasks usually involve precision: picking up, inserting into a drive, placing in a case.

**Feix's Grasp Taxonomy Categories (Simplified):**
Feix et al. (2015, ""The GRASP Taxonomy of Human Grasp Types"") categorize grasps based on (1) power/precision, (2) opposition type, (3) number of virtual fingers, and (4) the shape of the prehensile part of the hand.

Considering the object and typical tasks, a **Precision Grasp** is required, not a Power Grasp.

**Best Grasp Candidates:**

1.  **Tripod Grasp (Thumb-2 Fingers):**
    *   **Configuration A (Most Common & Secure for DVDs):** Index finger inserted into the central hole, thumb placed on the top surface (label side) near the hole, and the middle finger supporting the outer edge of the disc.
        *   *Opposition:* Pad opposition (thumb vs. index finger on inner rim) and support from the middle finger.
        *   *Virtual Fingers:* 3 (Thumb, Index, Middle).
        *   *Why ""Best"":* This grasp provides excellent stability and control, especially for insertion into a drive, while minimizing contact with the data surface. It's a very secure hold.

2.  **Precision Disc Grasp (also a form of Thumb-2 Fingers or Tripod):**
    *   **Configuration B (Edge Grasp):** Thumb on one side of the disc's outer edge, with the index and middle fingers (or just the index finger) opposing it on the other side of the outer edge.
        *   *Opposition:* Pad-to-pad opposition across the diameter/edge.
        *   *Virtual Fingers:* 2 or 3 (Thumb vs. Index, or Thumb vs. Index+Middle).
        *   *Why ""Good"":* This is also a common way to pick up a disc, especially from a flat surface, and keeps fingers off the data surfaces.

**Conclusion for ""Best"" Grasp:**

While both are valid precision grasps, the **Tripod Grasp (Configuration A, using the central hole)** is often considered the ""best"" and safest way to handle an optical disc for manipulation like inserting it into a drive. It offers superior control and security against dropping.

Therefore, based on Feix's taxonomy, the best grasp would be a:

**Tripod Grasp**

*   **Number of Virtual Fingers:** 3
*   **Specific Configuration:** Index finger through the central hole, thumb on the top surface, and middle finger on the outer edge for stabilization.
*   **Type:** Precision grasp.

This configuration allows for secure holding, precise orientation, and minimizes contact with the readable surface of the DVD."
